Option three and four are very similar in terms of actual effect on the atmosphere but option three is far more achievable. Enteric

 methane from livestock leaves an equilibrium amount of methane in the atmosphere which has already stabilized as livestock
 numbers have done. All that is left after the methane has degraded is the CO2 from whence it came in the first place. For this reason
 methane should always have considered as a separate issue and not just lumped in with all of the long term gases. A huge disservice

 has been done to New Zealand and agriculture in particular by this monumental blunder .For example the " 40% of our emissions
 from agriculture" that we hear so often is scientifically a nonsense yet we are at risk of making ridiculous policy decisions on the
 strength of it.As well as that, New Zealand's emissions are actually much less per person than we have declared . We are also wasting

 some $20m per year on research to mitigate emissions that in fact have very little effect on the planet.
