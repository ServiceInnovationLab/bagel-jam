Climate change needs to be given priority in this country. It is not important that compared to other countries, our emissions are
small. Per capita, our emissions are an embarrassment. We must act now. Climate change must be given priority in this country.

Interests of industrial sectors are important. The economy is important. But climate change MUST be given priority. This requires
immediate action. It also requires consistent, ongoing action. I am most concerned about the priority this Act will be given over time,

as throughout history the interests of building the economy has always reigned. While the economy undoubtedly will still grow while
prioritising climate change (and may even benefit), not everyone may see it this way. I am worried at how future governments will see

it. I'm worried climate change will never be prioritised because it is so nebulous, and its effects are so hard to understand and pin
upon a single phenomenon. Even today its effects are being felt, and people still deny climate change is the root as there is no

definitive scientific way of doing this. This act needs priority within our government. Please consider entrenching something so
important. The UK act that this bill is highly influenced by is so successful due to the bi-partisan support it has enjoyed over history.
We clearly don't have that yet. Therefore, entrenchment is the only protection this act may have over its lifetime. We must also

consider incentives in ensuring action happens. The less discussed aspect of the UK Act is that the country is now struggling to
keep up with the demands of its future targets. No one knows how they will be achieved and at present it is doubted they can be. No

target has yet been failed to be met, but this may change soon. So how will we make sure the same won't happen here? I doubt a
voluntary basis will be enough to create the change needed for the ambition currently proposed by the government.
