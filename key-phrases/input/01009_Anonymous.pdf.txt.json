The focus should be on reducing the source of man made emissions through subsidies of electric transportation and on innovation,

already being undetaken, in the agriculture sector to inhibit emissions. According to the NZAGRC agricultures net emissions have
fallen since 1990 due to higher efficiency. Agriculture should not be included in ETS when they are competing in the world market
with countries such as Norway whose farmers get 60% of their income from governement subsidies. More emphasis should be

placed on the use of humates and other microbial feeders to imprive soil aeration and root depth to increase the ability to sequester
carbon and drastically reduce the use of N fertilisers. I do not wish and do not consent to my submission to be published on the
ministry for the environments website.
