To me it seems that to date the accounting system, including the ETS, has been broken. Emissions in a biological cycle should not

be included. Forestry is not the fix all that government seems to think, it has many negative effects as well. If the accounting is done
properly I suspect that NZ's emissions in the world scheme of things are miniscule. There is alot of other pollution here that should

be dealt to, look at all the garbage that stores like The Warehouse, and the other "cheap crap" stores which are popping up
everywhere are bringing into the country all of which will ultimately end up in the landfill. Why don't you do something about that? And

reducing packaging - the gains that we make by bringing our re-usable bags to the supermarket are all lost by the likes of Pams
putting half a dozen tomatoes in a plastic container. And when you buy something the size of a matchbox on line, and it comes in a
whole lot of packaging? Why don't you do something about that? I think we will be buried in our own rubbish long before we run out of

oxygen or get frazzled by the sun.
