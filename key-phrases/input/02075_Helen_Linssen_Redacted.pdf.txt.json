Planting forestry in places where there was once thriving communities not only destroys communities as their is only minimal
employment and land owners will need to eat for the 25 years it takes to grow the trees also the destruction of the environment from
tree waste and truck damage to roads is expensive. The food that is no longer grown by sheep and beef farmers will still be grown in

the world to feed our increasing world population and therefore their is no net world gain by reducing our emissions produced by
growing sheep and beef a high protein grass based product grown by some of the most efficient producers in the world. This is

illogical because it doesn't reduce world emissions.
