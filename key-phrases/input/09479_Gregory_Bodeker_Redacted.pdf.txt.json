A Zero Carbon Act is important to me because it is clear to me that to avoid increasing global mean surface temperatures by more
than 2°C above pre-industrial levels, that there is a fixed amount of carbon that can be added to the atmosphere – there is no such

thing as a ‘sustainable level of CO2 emissions’. Therefore, ultimately, emissions must go to zero, and likely need to go negative some
time in the next few decades to avoid that 2°C threshold. It is imperative that by the time my children are my age we are no longer

adding carbon to the atmosphere. The process for achieving that goal must start now. The best way to implement that process is
through legislation. I am therefore 100% in support of the Zero Carbon Act goal of zero emissions by 2050.
