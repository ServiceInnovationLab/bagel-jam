A Zero Carbon Bill will create a vast bureaucracy: A Climate Change Commission, ‘emissions budgets’, climate change adaptation

plans, and emissions targets. Since livestock are carbon neutral, methane from agriculture should not be included in emissions
targets. Without methane, New Zealand would have one of the smallest greenhouse gas emissions profiles in the developed world.

In fact, no gases should be included in emissions targets, because just like the Emissions Trading Scheme, the proposed Zero
Carbon Bill will create a costly nightmare of red tape and bureaucracy that will waste time and money, drag down the economy, and

destroy businesses and jobs – all for no benefit.
