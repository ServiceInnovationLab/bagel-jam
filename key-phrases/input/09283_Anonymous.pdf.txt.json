The most important principle that medical doctors are taught is "Do no harm". I believe that this should be the over-riding principle for
the Bill in relation to the New Zealand economy. New Zealand's contribution to global emissions is miniscule and hamstringing the
country's economy in an attempt to make futile changes is, in my opinion, unforgivable. I do not wish my name or email address to be

published on the Ministry for the Environmentâ€™s website, in any release to the public under the Official Information Act or in any
summary of submissions that the Ministry may publish.
