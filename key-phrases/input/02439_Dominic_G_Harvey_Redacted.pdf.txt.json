Having spent my 20s living in Kenya where the average energy consumption was 0.5 barrels of oil per year (energy equivalent) and

my 30s in California where people were 90 times as consumptive I am aware of just how far from a sustainable base line we are. As an
Ocean Engineer and Marine Warranty Surveyor I spent the 90s overseeing the installation of very large offshore oil and gas facilities
including Hibernia and those of the North Dome field offshore Qatar. I moved to New Zealand looking for a more balanced and

sustainable lifestyle for myself and my family. But, apart from the low ratio of people to the environment have not found it here. New
Zealand is in a unique position of being able to use its low population and isolated ecosystem to lead the world in alternative

sustainable living. Whether it chooses to do so remains to be seen. However, I believe like the rest of the world it will soon have little
choice.
