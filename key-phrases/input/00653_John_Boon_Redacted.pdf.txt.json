Why is there not more emphasis on changing regulation of the power industry? At best this industry has green-washed whilst
introducing many barriers to entry for micro generation in discriminatory pricing in which those who invest in green power micro
generation are effectively subsidising those who do not. This works against any zero carbon strategy the government may have. The

industry needs re-regulating to ensure a positive contribution and support for those who personally want to help make zero carbon a
reality at their own cost and risk. It's low hanging fruit for the government.
