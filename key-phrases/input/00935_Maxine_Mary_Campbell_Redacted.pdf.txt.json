Stephen Hawking thought we should find another planet to live on, such is the damage we have inflicted on our current one. To date,

we don't know of another habitable planet (and if there is one, we are probably the worst thing that could happen to it), so our efforts
need to be dedicated to making this one healthy again. Our children and grandchildren are destined to carry a greater climate burden

than the baby boom generation has, though the burden has been fashioned largely by the boomers. Those in developing countries,
who have benefited least from "modern conveniences", are paying the greatest price and will continue to do so. Changes in our

behaviours now can begin to reduce the misery into the future. Our actions to date have taken scant account of the long term
consequences; inaction now would be unforgivable.
