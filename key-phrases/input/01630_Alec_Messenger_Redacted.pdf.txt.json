Planting trees is a clear part of reaching our zero carbon target. We need to ensure that we are planting trees that are of long term
ecological benefit to the region in which they are planted. Forestry is likely to be a part of this equation but should only be a part due

to negative ecological impact of forestry in some areas (effects of monoculture on biodiversity, runoff and environmental damage
during harvesting, loss of carbon sink between harvesting and replanting.
