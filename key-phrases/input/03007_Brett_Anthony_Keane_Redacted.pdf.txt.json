We have been studying this subject for years ( I have a Degree and Grad Dip (Massey 2006) and 70yrs of experience. We recently identified the onset of the current 'Quiet Sun' period and

anticipate the current cooling phase to last at least 20yrs more. In the cycle (mainly from oceanic solar input) of c63yrs, we are at a similar stage to the early 1960s which I remember well. It is
not hotter now. We also know why Maurice Strong started this CAGW thing. It is political, not scientific. "On page 982 from WD1AR5 final they don​t call it a plateau, but it is what it is." ​The ASK

results and the initialised predictions both suggest that those CMIP5 models that warm most rapidly over the period (1986​2005) to (2016​2035) may be inconsistent with the observations.​
