Include research on low tech / appropriate tech solutions thereby providing for local community resilience and reduced
environmental impact of solutions (high tech has more unforseen consequences.) Consider military preparedness for increased

resource-based conflicts especially in Pacific. Increase diplomatic work and joint planning with other nations to reduce likelihood of
resource-based conflicts particularly where we could be drawn in through traditional alliances. Consider how to build internal

economy so country can better weather downturns in export and especially tourist sectors.
