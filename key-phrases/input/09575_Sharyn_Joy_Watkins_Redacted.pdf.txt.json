These 8 words are the death of climate change - "It violates the Equivalence Principle, therefore it's wrong." The Equivalence Principle

says - If data cannot distinguish between two things, then the two things are identical. The IPCC claims human emissions will linger in
the atmosphere for hundreds of years, and 15% will remain forever. That claim violates the Equivalence Principle. Nature's CO2 has a

half life in the atmosphere of only 2.8 years. Therefore human CO2 also has a half life of 2.8 years. Nature cannot distinguish between
the two sources.
