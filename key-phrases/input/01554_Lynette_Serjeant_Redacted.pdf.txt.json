I endorse the following comment from Jeanette Fitzsimons: There's nothing magical about 2050. Rapid reductions now, taking

advantage of all the easy options right away, then slowing down the rate when things get harder, will warm the climate less by 2050
than waiting till the last minute, then taking extreme action.
