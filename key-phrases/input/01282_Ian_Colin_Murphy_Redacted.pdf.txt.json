Solar scientists are claiming that due to the current 11 year low solar cycle 24 and even lower solar cycle 25 forecast we are heading
 for a freezing period of possibly some 30 to 50 years ahead. With current global satellite temperatures being similar to those of a
 dozen and more years ago, it appears the Solar Scientists are correct and you are planning for warming when you should be planning

 for cooling temperatures in the years ahead. I have just checked the ice extent graphs for the Arctic and the Antarctic and both show
 increased ice extent this year. Global temperatures over the last years since the recent El Nino are showing a rapid decline even
 though carbon fuel use is increasing worldwide. Carbon dioxide is a vital gas at only 0.04 % of the atmosphere by volume that plants

 need and thrive on. The amount man produces is even less at 0.0004%. That is such a tiny amount it can be hard to imagine so I
 have made a calculation..... If the earths atmosphere is represented by a sheet of A4 paper, then mans contribution of CO2 is
 represented by a tiny full stop. Yet that miniscule dot of CO2 is supposed to be Earths climate control knob ??? You need to seriously

 consider that those Solar Scientists are correct and planning needs to be made now for a cooling period ahead with all the problems
 that will bring for various power production, power transmission and outages, housing warmth, difficulties with food production and
 shorter growing periods, transport and vehicle fuel supplies.
