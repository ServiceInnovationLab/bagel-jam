It shouldn't be the Government to tackle this issue, whenever the government tries to change human behaviour it always backfires. It

should be left to innovative businesses and technology which overtime will reduce emissions. Also more study should be done to
see if human made emission are causing a adverse effects. The planet is over 300 million years old and we only have scientific data
from the last few hundred years, with only a third being accurate.
