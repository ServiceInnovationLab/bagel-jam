You cannot please all the people all of the time. Many people and groups will be unhappy with this Act, but it is essential that this
government pushes ahead with it as quickly as possible. At the time that motor cars were gradually being introduced, if governments

had been swayed by blacksmiths, farriers, vets, makers of horseshoes, saddles and riding equipment and clothes, we would still be
driving around in a pony and trap. Those people eventually accepted and adapted, even though at the time they hated those

responsible for introducing motorised transport. We must have the same strength of purpose.
