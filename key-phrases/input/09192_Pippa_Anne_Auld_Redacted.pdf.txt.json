It is a relief to finally see some tangible action being taken by government on this issue! NZ contribute a very small proportion of
global emissions but that does not in anyway excuse us from action, especially considering our high per capita emissions and
emissions that are likely incurred offshore in relation to our own consumption. It is time NZ lays out a pathway to a positive and

environmental regenerative future to work towards and ensure the future liveability of our country and planet.
