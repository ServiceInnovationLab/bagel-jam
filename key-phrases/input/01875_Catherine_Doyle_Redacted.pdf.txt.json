New Zealand has a great opportunity to lead in many areas, including adapting farming practices to a more sustainable model. This
could see a huge reduction in nitrate fertilizer application and drought resistant pasture, so no more irrigation which wastes millions

of gallons of precious water. Less nitrates means cleaner streams and rivers. Use of new feeds for cows can significantly reduce
methane emissions and the entire environment, both atmosphere and terrestrial can be vastly improved. Reforestation using native

trees as much as possible will greatly improve New Zealand's environment and start to restore the 'Clean Green' image. All these
changes along with a reduction in industrial and mechanical pollution will help to slow global warming and hopefully impact on the

increasingly chaotic climate changes.
