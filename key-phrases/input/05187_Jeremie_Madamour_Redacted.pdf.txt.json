The proposal about commission power is binary (decision power or no power at all), which will sadly influence the outcome of the

submissions you are gathering : It should have been a more open question. The commission should have at least a power of veto on
the government budget if it doesn't comply with the 2050 goal. I would like the government to explore the idea of an other chamber

of elected people with power of decision targeted on long term issues (climate change, but also other matters for generations to
come).
