I want to reiterate my total opposition to the E.T.S. The governments review of the scheme in 2016 found that it had had no
significant effect in reducing emissions. Other countries have had similar problems. I favour a carbon tax which is initially set at the

current market level of ETS credits. It should automatically increase by 5% cumulatively each year so that polluters can see from the
outset that reducing emissions is the only acceptable way of staying in business. Credits could be used to pay the tax during the first

5 years but would stay at the 2018 market price, so that they would steadily become less valuable in paying the tax. We must keep as
a top priority, the need to stop further global warming and also work towards reversing warming that has already taken place so that
we can return to temperatures as at mid 20th century & around 350 ppm of CO2 or less in the atmosphere. I suggest two measures

which will help achieve a zero carbon economy: 1) Legislate to stop the sales of new internal combustion engines by 2040 or earlier.
If this is done now then individuals and businesses will get a clear message that fossil fuel use is on the way out. Transport

contributes 19% of NZ CO2 emissions plus some N2O emissions so will have to be cut some time anyway. 2) Legislate that all new
buildings must be energy self sufficient. This will have a dual effect of taking the strain off energy providers as electric vehicles make

more demands on the system, and also provide for charging EV's at home and work without using grid power. The other advantage
would be to make buildings more resilient after earthquakes or other natural disasters.
