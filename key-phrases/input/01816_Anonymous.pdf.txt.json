Your reports notes "The costs from climate change are already high and growing." So why further penalize New Zealanders (and it will

be mostly the poorest) to impress offshore unelected bureaucrats ? Why are you turning up the fear? NZ already uses mostly
renewable energy, has perhaps the worlds most efficient farming practices and an emissions output so low as to be negligible in

impact on the atmosphere. (and don't quote per-capita emissions output - those figures are a fiction- only total emissions count IF
you are serious about solving this over hyped issue - working on a per-captia basis suggests the issue is not at all pressing)

Fortunately, the modeled impacts of "Climate Change" are vastly over-hyped - and we do have far more pressing issues to deal with in
NZ right now. The Government should instead commit the billions that will be wasted in Climate Mitigation & Zero Carbon Target

administration to NZ' s Children's health, safety and education. All we have to do to combat Climate Change is take off the jersey and
walk inland slowly.
