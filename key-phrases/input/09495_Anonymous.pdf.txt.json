I am involved in a very progressive local community gardenand an active Transition Towns Pt Chevalier member where we discuss CC
issues and trying to do our informed bit as much as we can - we could have a bigger impact if govt sets targets and we are enabled

to recruit more people on board to help reach these targets on an individual/household local basis. I am actively involved in activities
with the group to support sustainable living practices. I also feel we as a quite wealthy country must address some of the excessive

damage we have created to climate change that is affecting our Pacific Island neighbours who are suffering the most and have been
minimal emitters. It is because of these interests and social concerns and my concern for the planet and for future generations that I

fully support the Green Party in its aim to pass the Zero Carbon Act as proposed. My partner and I don't have children and are in our
mid-late 50s, we could just go ahead, enjoy our live and fcku up the planet as there's no blood-relative coming after us - but that's not
how we think, we want as many people as fit healthily on this earth without living over its boundaries to enjoy the one life they are

given - just as we are allowed to.
