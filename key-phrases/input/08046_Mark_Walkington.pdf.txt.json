The introduction of this bill is a great step and very required - although decades too late. Government needs to keep continual focus
on emission reduction and be prepared for NZ to take necessary measures to lead in the battle against Carbon. Much education is

needed - this is certainly part of the role for the Climate Commission. Threats to the successful meeting of the budget need to be
identified and handled. Similarly win-win scenarios abound in this space e.g. tourism, public health, efficiency and cost reduction, new

technology and innovation, green jobs ...... and much can be made of each step we make on our way to Net Zero. Consideration
needs to be given to changing market structures where current arrangements have been seen to work against the need for change.
Examples include electricity where incumbents generators are happy to delay the build of renewable generation - for fear of lowering

market prices and disturbing windfall profits. If we are to see a widespread electrification of transport and industry then it is likely that
new wind and geothermal generation will be needed post haste. Similarly infrastructure provision such as EV Charging requires a role

for the state either significant funding or direct action (e.g. California) - here benefits are spread widely and do not make a commercial
profit easily achieved.
