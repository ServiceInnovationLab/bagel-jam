If farming is going to be engaged in this it must be done in good faith that all grass land, trees, scrub and any other forms of carbon
fixing should be calculated. Other areas of reducing costs for farmers should also be considered eg Rates (local and regional), Health

and safety, animal welfare costs, inheritance costs. I fear that in this process that the NZ farmers exports will nolonger be able to
compete in the rest of the worlds markets
