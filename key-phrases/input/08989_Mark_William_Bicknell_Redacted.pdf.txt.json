It is quickly becoming apparent that proposed legislation on New Zealand's carbon emissions is likely leading towards unfair and
inequitable treatment of ruminant biological emissions. It is clear on scientific basis that ruminant carbon emissions occur in a closed

carbon cycle and thus are neutral in their contribution to atmospheric carbon. In order to avoid any unfairness or inequities in
government legislation such emissions must either be excluded or have their entire carbon cycle recognised. Doing so will ensure

fairness and equity and will also prevent important export industries that rely on ruminant animals from being disadvantaged in world
markets.
