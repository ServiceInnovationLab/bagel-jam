On March 2017 I became a grandmother for the first time. My granddaughter was 8 weeks premature. Doctors do not know why my
daughter in law didn't carry to term. My granddaughter is a survivor and at 16 months she is developing in the prem spectrum. A little

behind, but doing fine. Now, her family is concerned about the survival of New Zealand. Finally, with everything we know as fact about
the warming of the planet and our oceans, we have a government that is working towards solutions for my future and my

grandaughter's future. Last February, we had 2 hurricanes (I prefer to call tropical cyclones hurricanes) rip though our Tasman Bay
destroying 2 iconic, waterfront buildings. The REASON these hurricanes went South instead of their typical Northerly direction is

beacuse the Tasman Sea was 6 degrees warmer than "normal'. Now, Nelson/Tasman residents need to learn about hurricane
protection/survival. The new norm. Including adaptation is essential. Having a Climate Change Commission that is part of government
forever...a new government can't come in and undo it is also essential.
