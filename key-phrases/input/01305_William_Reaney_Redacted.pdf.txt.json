The science of man-made global warming is not settled. Zero emission targets based on ideologies and not settled science is not a
sound policy. Your plan must be based on cold, hard scientific numbers only. Your plan is destructive, not constructive. India and

China are the two largest emitters of CO2 and it is common knowledge that these countries, including Germany, Japan, and France,
plan to construct 1,600+ coal-fired power plants. NZs contribution to global carbon dioxide emissions is negligible (close to zero).
Rather than legislate a new emissions target for NZ, focus efforts to convince President Xi Jinping or Prime Minister, Narendra Modi to

follow your proposed tax theory to reduce CO2 emissions, then your effort would be laudable within your ideological drive. Your
advisors knowledge of science is wrong. Use of the expression Carbon Bill and not Carbon Dioxide bill is evidence of that. The target,

if NZ needs one, should be based on settled science. NZ Government have not considered all arguments of the global warming
science. It is now common knowledge that global temperatures have not increased in the last 20 years. Other countries (including

India and China) still plan to construct coal fired power stations, which will increase CO2 emissions significantly (+40% estimated). So
a net zero carbon dioxide emission reduction by NZ is a futile exercise and will do next to nothing for global emissions. The bill will
hurt NZ residents.
