Any further farm conversions to dairying should be disallowed and support given to farmers willing to revert to cropping or sheep
farming. Water for irrigation should come at a premium. There should be encouragement and support given to businesses finding
new uses for wool - a great example is Allbirds (shoes). Attention needs to be given to educating the public on the consequences of

climate change, the astromonical price of inaction, as well as the inevitable cost of action. Sacrifices will be required and, in a world
where progress seems to be measured in only material terms, many will find this a bitter pill to swallow unless they fully understand

the alternative. Forestry is obviously a huge priority but if it's to consist mostly of pines there would need to be some provision made
for dealing with wilding seedlings making their unwelcome presence known in areas of native bush or scenic value like the McKenzie

Basin. If electric cars are to take on in a big way there will need to be a proliferation of charging stations all over the country to deal
with so-called "range anxiety".
