I would like to see greater incentives for EVs. NZ has great existing infrastructure for EVs but very weak incentives - far lower than
many other countries despite our clear advantages in this area. We also risk being a dumping ground for stranded ICE vehicles. There

is significant pent up demand internationally for quality EVs and only limited production capacity (look at the Tesla Model 3 waiting list
& the Hyundai Kona EV is sold out in many markets). We may also see ICE vehicles being more aggressively marketed in NZ as they
lose market share to EVs internationally - this is an inevitable market response in countries without incentives or fuel efficiency

requirements. My household will be replacing one of our vehicles at the end of the year and I am actively shopping for a suitable EV,
however my options are either too expensive or unsuitable. I also consider the environmental benefits of PHEVs to be overstated, as

well as economics not stacking up considering the additional upfront cost and maintenance. The feebate system proposed by the
Productivity Commission would make the higher upfront cost of a suitable EV more palatable.
