We are a small country that has capacity to embrace change quickly (because of our size), this needs to be about the people. Every

day NZers need to feel a part of this, they need to be informed and empowered to contribute the change in their own lives (this
means leadership, direction, clear guidelines that filter through to local govt), while seeing bigger picture change supported at a

national level. If this sits at the top, powered by 'experts' it will not have the same impact as a 'by the people for the people' approach.
There is so much willingness, knowledge, 'expertise' and capacity within the social networks of NZ to create significant and
meaningful change, its vital the Govt does not ignore this.
