Electric cars - a significant increase in electric cars would have considerable benefits to NZ 1. Reduced emissions from combustion
 cars 2. Reduced balance of payments from reduced oil imports 3. Utilise our high level of renewable energy. Currently electric cars are

 considerably more expensive than combustion cars which is reducing uptake. To increase the numbers of electric cars you should
 remove GST from electric cars for 5 years and (if required) increase duty on diesel cars to fund it. Diesel cars are being phased out in
 Europe as they produce considerable emissions. Also consider funding a buy back scheme for cars which use more than 10 litres

 per 100kms. and are more than 10 year old to tak old and inefficient cars off the road.
