In agriculture it is management that determines whether the farm is a net source or sink. We either degrade the land or regenerate
depending on grazing policies. Regeneration sequesters carbon in soil and increased biomass. Same applies for forestry and
horticulture. To say a cow burps methane and a tree is made of wood is grossly over simplistic. If your best solution is more radiata

pine monocultures and all the negative environmental consequences of that we are truly devoid of imagination.
