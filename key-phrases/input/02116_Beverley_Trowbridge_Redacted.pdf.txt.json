Just to reiterate the importance of Regenerative Farming to our climate adaptation plans. this whole area is currently missing from

government & climate change commissionâ€™s thinking. In Tai Tokerau we are setting up a climate change trust and regenerative
farming is one of our key approaches for tackling climate change for the region. We have people available to talk to the CC

Commission about the value of taking a regenerative farming approach for NZ, as well as farms to see this in action.
