New Zealand has been inactive on carbon emissions for too long, with emissions up by 20% compared to 1990, while countries like
Germany, France, Denmark and others have been reducing carbon emissions. New Zealand needs to reduce emissions urgently and

rapidly. We owe this to future generations and our neighbours in the pacific that are threatened by rising sea levels and increasing
extreme weather events.
