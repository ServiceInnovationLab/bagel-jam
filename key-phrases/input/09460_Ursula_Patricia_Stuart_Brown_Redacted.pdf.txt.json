Yes. New Zealand has an important role to play in world politics. Our small size and relative independence is an advantage. We can try
new ways of doing things which are difficult for countries with larger populations. We are used to innovation and are resourceful .i
believe our children's future lies in protecting our natural resources. These I suggest will become ever more valuable and the main

source of our economy. I also think, that as long as the economy is not going backward, there is not much to worry about providing
that what there is is shared!
