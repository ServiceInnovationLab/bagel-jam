I am concerned that NZ will become unaffordable for New Zealanders as energy, transport, and other sectors will see costs go up.
Then employment will suffer due to the manufacturing and production areas of our economy, especially agriculture, will see their
costs go up as well. Retail is not a economic activity that signals the health of the economy. Hoping and suggesting that technology

innovation will compensate for other emissions heavy sectors cost increases is difficult to see for NZ. Rather let market forces
determine that outcome.
