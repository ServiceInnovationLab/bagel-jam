Don't think that central government should have responsibility for the detailed adaptation planning for the whole country. Having a

hierarchy guided by central government would be more useful by providing strong guidance while allowing for a measure of variation
to suit local contexts and distributing some of the administrative load. Will be most successful if central government also provides a
supporting role empowering local government to effectively plan within the guidance, priorities etc. laid out by central government.
