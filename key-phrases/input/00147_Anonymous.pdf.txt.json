Humans have no effect on the climate. CO2 pays no role in warming the planet. IPCC models have failed, and continue to fail,

because they attempt to shoehorn a vital trace gas into a role in which it plays no part. The arctic has not melted, winters have not
stopped and they never will. The sun is the primary driver of earth's climate, with modifications by cosmic rays, which modify both

solar activity and volcanic activity. The current warming from the last glacial period has come to an end, and from here on in it is going
to get colder. To destroy our economy and energy wealth to attempt to take control of something by limiting a vital trace gas is
criminal.
