NZ largely depends on agriculture and is a world leader in this industry - the current proposal puts too much emphasis on reducing all

gases by 2050 without too much thought into what will happen to the agriculture industry and the flow on aeffects to all New
Zealanders as to standard of living ,wages ,jobs and general well being. A best case would be to target Co2 and working towards

clean energy and clean transport that is electrical vehicles.
