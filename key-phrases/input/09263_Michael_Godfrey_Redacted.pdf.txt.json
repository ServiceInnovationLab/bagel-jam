This is an excellent bill that is absolutely vital to pass. Once passed, I would like to see effective ways of reducing emissions (like

electric cars, zero use of coal, public transport, clean farming) communicated to the public and encouraged so they become
mainstream and an accepted part of normal social behaviour.
