1). I am fully in support of a transition away from individual vehicles, particularly in cities, but this must be supported by a significant
investment in public transport infrastructure. 2) For decades we have heard for about the need to exempt farmers (animal agriculture)

from emission trading schemes. New Zealand prides itself on being innovative. The number-8-wire response to climate change and
emission reductions will not be had through the development of vaccines that inhibit ruminant methane emissions. It will be through

developing clean alternatives to meat, wool and dairy. The movement away from the consumption of animal products and the
adoption of plant-based diets and textiles, is the biggest social shift of our time. Innovators have responded to this - lab grown meat
has already been developed. Lab grown dairy products will likely follow. New Zealand can innovate to meet new market demands, and

could be a world leader in the organic sector (which might also make our 100% Pure brand more honest, unlike the uncomfortable
misrepresentation that it is today). We can do this. We MUST do this.
