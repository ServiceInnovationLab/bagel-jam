While the 2050 date and the idea of staged five year emission budgets might convey a calm, considered process we need to keep in
mind that right now in almost any given week in New Zealand we have housing, infrastructure and agricultural output being destroyed

by weather related cold, drought, flooding and wind with invasive species being enabled and diseases spreading. What we might plan
at our pace within our considerations of GDP and 'political reality' actually has no relation to the speed at which the climate is
changing and the impacts are appearing. To do anything less than put into legislation the most ambitious emissions reductions we

can is to lose any chance of getting ahead of the pace of the changes we've already started. We throw not only caution to the wind,
but the basis of our civilisation.
