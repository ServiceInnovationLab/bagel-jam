Do not sacrifice our national economy for the virtue-signalling changes proposed. There is too much doubt about the relationship of
CO2 to 'climate change', NZ's total emissions are so small as not to make any difference to the global emissions budget, and our own

emissions do not effect our own climate as they blow away. If we really want to have a nuclear moment, perhaps we should consider
admitting that CO2 is not pollution, and has such a tiny effect on climate that we should just accept the cost of adjusting and
adapting as a cheaper and better return on our investment.
