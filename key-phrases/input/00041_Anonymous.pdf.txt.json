The commission must be independent, lack conflicts of interest (business interests that is), have the authority to set new rules and
targets and enforce them if there is inaction on behalf of govt. It must be as transparent as possible, work on behalf of people and

not profit and have the spine to stand up to powerful business interests that have vested interests that conflict with the health of the
environment. There also needs to be a lot more focus on agriculture and their impact on the environment. They are the single largest

contributor to greenhouse gasses and have done immense damage to our environment. They need to be held responsible and
must adapt to the changes that must be made to save our environment
