Please do not plant more Pinus Radiata!! we have far to many already. We need trees that make quality timber not sap wood that is

dependent of chemicals for durability. Farms can have up to one third of the area planted in trees and grow more grass. We need a
much more integrated landscape according to the capabilities of the land
