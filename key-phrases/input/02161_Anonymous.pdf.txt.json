Please listen to the people of Aotearoa. I am trying to parent my child, nurse sick patients and follow my own dreams, while every day
my heart is breaking when fearing for the health of my community, the condition of our beautiful and precious planet and the state of

our sacred waters. I work very hard, and for long hours and then am reduced to tears while walking down the aisles of the
supermarket. Because I feel guilty for every single product I buy that I cannot afford/do not have the time to source elsewhere, that
may be contributing to the demise of our environment. I am tired of plastic and oil being the ruling powers of our times. It is

exhausting, when you care, to be faced with endless arguments about economics, convenience, capital and freedom to profit. These
things will never matter as much as our air, land and water. The health of our souls, minds and bodies. No wonder we are in a state of

mental crisis. We cannot keep ignoring this problem. Thank you so much for creating this stepping stone, and may it be honoured
with enough detail and integrity to prevent it becoming lip service and box ticking.
