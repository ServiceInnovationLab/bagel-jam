The climate change situation we face is existential. We need to be bold and address it aggressively, but with practicality in mind. Most
of the technical solutions we require are now already in place (with the exception of practical livestock methane solutions). What is

missing is political will and clear economic signals where the true externalized costs of climate change are included. We also need to
change our mindset and understand that change is coming so we should embrace it and reap the rewards of the many benefits it will
bring.
