As mentioned earlier, I think it's important that the goal posts might have to be moved towards a carbon negative economy. This can

be achieved with including some form of support for organic and holistic soil management/agriculture and horticulture - imaginable is
a reward and penalty system for carbon negative or positive farming/forestry methods. Organic certification providers could be roped

in for this process combined with random soil testing and/or other methods (needs researching).
