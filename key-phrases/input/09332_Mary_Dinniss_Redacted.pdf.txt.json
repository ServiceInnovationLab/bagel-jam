We need to move faster. We need to see progress. Individuals need the resources to implement what they can, when they can, as

they can. A structured education policy would be more use than - "We are already seeing significant climate change." Show us, that
by doing what we can it will make a difference and how we can make the most significant difference. I don't need convincing, but
there are thousands of citizens out there that can't really see how they can contribute and why.
