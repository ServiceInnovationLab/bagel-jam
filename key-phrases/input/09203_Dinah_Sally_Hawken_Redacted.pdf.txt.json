I'd like to say that our adjustment to climate change is urgent and couldn't be more fundamental to our well-being both now and in
the future. I'd like to see the process of making change to reduce emissions to be based on all the sense, intelligence and care for

the environment that we are capable of. This form frustrates me a little because of it's narrow, technical focus and little
acknowledgement of the more general concerns that most NZers understand and focus on, and would like to express in a

submission. We can't always easily understand and assess your yes or no format.
