Newer technology like solar power and electric vehicles need to be better supported either through legislation e.g. all new

houses/commercial buildings need to include solar panels, or subsidy programme so that they are available to a wider cross section
of New Zealanders. The bigger the market for these technologies the more the price will drop and make them a much more viable
option and more businesses will get into providing these types of technologies.
