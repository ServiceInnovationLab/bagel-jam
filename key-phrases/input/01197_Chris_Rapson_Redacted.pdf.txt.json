This bill is very very important. Climate change is an externality from so many human endeavours that leadership must come from
central government. I hope NZ's government will set a course to reach net zero emissions and eliminate our contribution to a global

problem. Beyond the scope of this bill, I hope they advocate internationally for other countries to match our goals. The current
practice of exempting livestock emissions from the ETS is arbitrary and unfair to other industries. The effect on our climate is the

same regardless of where gasses are produced, and our policy should reflect that.
