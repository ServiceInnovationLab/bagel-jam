Please don't take your time planning and discussing- every minute that happens, thats every more minute that a factory produces

harmful fossil fuels, and cars on roads. Please just take action now as all the evidence is there. Look at modern, eco-friendly counries
such as Finland, Iceland, Sweden, Spain. Thank you for all your guys' hard work <3 Just don't pay yourselves as if you are gods and
get 300,000 dollars a year and use that money for our world which may not be here for that much longer if we don't do something

now :)
