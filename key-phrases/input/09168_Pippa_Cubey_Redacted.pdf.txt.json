I have lived beside the Makara river in Wellington, less than 1km from the coast for the last 20 years. Over the last ten years, flooding

and storms have become more frequent. Or community is at risk of disappearing completely if we do not slow climate change. As a
middle-low income family, our home is our only asset, and our children's heritage. But more importantly, I want my children and their

future children to be able to grow up in a safe environment, which will almost definitely not be possible unless we take very clear and
brave actions to slow the current climate change. New Zealand is in an ideal situation to take a global lead on this matter, we can't

afford not to.
