The Bill's title should be changed to read: The Xero Emissions Bill because it must apply to all greenhouse gases not just carbon.

The utmost urgency must be applied to setting up the Climate Change Commission. The changes set in motion by decades of global
polluting cannot be stopped by a few political decisions, hoping the problem will go away. We will all be affected for generations to

come. The actions taken now can only mitigate these effects. However without serious action now, life on Earth will be far worse.
Show strength, vision and integrity in leading the way. Kia kaha.
