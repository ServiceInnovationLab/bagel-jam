We are a small country with a history of innovation which should make us ideally placed to enact real, substantial and revolutionary
change. We must resist the calls of those who for economic or social reasons want to retain the status quo. We cannot continue to

use resources and create waste (be it landfill or gas emissions) in the way we are doing at the moment. Investment in a 'greener'
economy will pay dividends in the the future not just in terms of climate change but also economical, social and lifestyle benefits that

need to be for all in Aotearoa.
