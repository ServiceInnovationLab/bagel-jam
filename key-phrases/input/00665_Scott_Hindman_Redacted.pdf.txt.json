Adapting to, and doing what we can to reduce climate change is the most important thing facing humans in our lifetime. We have

been handed a HUGE problem by our ancestors, and it has fallen on us to deal with the issue before it becomes "unsolvable" with
disastrous outcomes for us and future generations. We should have acted 100 years ago. We must act now. It is URGENT. The

economy and business and the public in general will not be able to tackle this themselves. It needs strong leadership from
government to do whats best for it's people. And that is to create an environment that humans can survive in for the foreseeable

future. We also have a role to play on the world stage, developing and sharing solutions, and leading the way to show what can be
done, with a little number 8 wire kiwi ingenuity.
