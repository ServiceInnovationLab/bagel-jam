The Climate Change Commission should be established under a legislative framework that ensured it was not disbanded at the whim

of any future government. Given that political circumstances in New Zealand where, in almost all situations, the government of the
day controls Parliament, and the constitutional ability of Parliament to amend or repeal any statutes, some legislative security needs to
be provided for the Commission.
