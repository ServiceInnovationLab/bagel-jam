Even though it seems clear that the UN and the IPCC believe they have an understanding of the future of the planets climate the
science is not settled. As an MSc in Earth Science and now 28 years of reading and understanding of the sciences behind how our

planet works I am deeply troubled that we are rushing into policy without a reasonable certainty of the science. The precautionary
principle is usually used when there is no real risk of negative affect and in this legislation there is massive risk to our most vulnerable

population. There is no harm in waiting for a year or two to at least have a better understanding of what the future holds. There are
many examples in the literature and in the data, for instance, that show no risk of sealevel reaching even the range of heights
mentioned in the report within 100 years (NZ data used). Nor is there any evidence that substantiates the increase in extreme

weather events beyond normal background events. I note there is no obvious way to verbally submit on this bill but I am happy to
present to the Ministry at any time required post submission date data that shows the hypothesis "Increasing Human caused CO2 in

the atmosphere will cause accelerated sea level rise, increased severity and frequency of extreme weather, acidification of the worlds
oceans or catastrophic melting of the polar ice caps" has already failed and that we may well be embarking on a fools errand. There
are areas of pollution that we do need to remedy but this bill will go no way towards any of that and is likely to cost us as New

Zealanders dearly. How do I make a verbal submission?
