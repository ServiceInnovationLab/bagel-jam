I wish to speak in support of my submission at any hearings or select committee process that arises in this consultation process. I
believe this is the most important legislation considered in the 52nd Parliament. Need to take an exponential decay approach, i.e.

biggest decreases in emissions in early years, moderate in mid years, and slower in last years. There needs to be a strong
compulsion on all local govts in NZ to set and deliver on these budgets as well; otherwise you'll get all sorts of cross boundary
failures to set appropriate strategy and planning in place at local level. Many Councils are in denial. For instance Horizons Regional

Council was presented with numerous submissions during the 2018 Long Term Plan consultation that lay out the rationale for setting
a GHG emissions abatement target. A subsequent recommendation to establish such a target was only briefly considered, and lost

10-2. Without compulsion on local govt, there will be a major and dangerous lag in delivery on the NZ budgets.
