I am concerned that the Zero Carbon Act will not be resilient against powerful lobby groups. The existing oil and gas sector, the dairy
industry, farming in general, the automotive industry and the big players in the electricity sector will all try to water down and slow

down the necessary action that we need to take. I am also concerned that international trade agreements may also slow down
progress. It is important that the positive opportunities that arise from addressing climate change and the moral obligation to do so

are highlighted. If we delay action it will be far more expensive and we will be less likely to succeed. I believe that all effort needs to be
done to get agreement across all sectors of business and the community if this is going to work.
