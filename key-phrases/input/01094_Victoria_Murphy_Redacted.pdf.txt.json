What ever is set, it must be based on science, please refer to your document. Any target we set needs to be informed by the best

available climate change science. Nearly half of New Zealand’s greenhouse gas emissions come from agriculture, which means we
need to pay particular attention to the scientific impact of short-lived gases like methane, which dominate agriculture’s emissions.

SHORT-LIVED AND LONG-LIVED GASES Short-lived gases like methane decay relatively rapidly in the atmosphere. They last for
decades rather than centuries. This means global temperatures can be stabilised without necessarily reducing emissions of these
gases to zero. We also have an opportunity to lower the impact even further by not only stabilising but also, where possible, reducing

short-lived gases from our economy. Long-lived gases like carbon dioxide either need to reduce entirely to zero or at least to the
point where emissions can be balanced out by an equal amount of removals.
