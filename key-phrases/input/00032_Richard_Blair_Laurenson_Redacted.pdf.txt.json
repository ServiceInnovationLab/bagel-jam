It is of paramount importance that the soils role be recognised in this issue in order to encourage farming practice to increase the
soils organic matter. "A great deal of the carbon once stored in the soil is now stored in the atmosphere - 30% of CO2 can be

countered by humus-building (based upon just the top 15cm)" Graeme Saite . Humus Saves the World, Ted Talk. Moreover it has
been estimated that a 1% increase in US crop lands alone would take take 4.5 billion tonnes of CO2 from the atmosphere and return

it to the soil. Recognition of this principle and applied to NZ will have huge benefit to the proposed Carbon budgets.
