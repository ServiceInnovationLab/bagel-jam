I have worked as an agronomist on farms for nearly 30 years. Over his time I have seen a lot of my clients soils improving over time

and building organic matter. Those who use a lot of artificial nitrogen fertiliser or cultivation lose organic matter. Although livestock
may emit a lot of methane and nitrous oxide which are greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, if the soil is acting as a carbon sink,

then this needs to be considered. I have also observed with forestry conversions to pasture, that initially there is very little topsoil the
first year or two, but over time there is a definite topsoil layer being built which is permanent C being held in the soil once it turns
certain to humic compounds. Forestry is not the be all and end all, soils which have grown a crop of trees have less soil carbon than

what sheep and beef farms will have sequestered over the same time. Trees can act as a carbon sink, but once harvested, the
carbon is gone. Soil carbon sequestration is one long term answer to increased CO2 levels and needs to be considered in the big

picture if there is going to be honest science in this whole discussion. Just because Simon Upton excluded soil carbon in the 1990
Kyoto Accord, does not mean it should be excluded in future accords or developments. Scientific knowledge is an ever improving,

more precise pool of knowledge, and needs to be free from political agendas/interference.
