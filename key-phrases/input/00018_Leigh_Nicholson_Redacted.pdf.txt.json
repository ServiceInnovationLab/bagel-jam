I think this is a fantastic and well researched document which makes an important first step. Congratulations! In order for this to be of

maximum benefit - we need to ensure a high proportion of NZ people engage with it. This requires a lot of targeted marketing - This
needs a very strong Stakeholder and Communications Management Strategy. A great job and well done . I would welcome any further
discussions on the subject
