I'm happy to be contacted about any of this. Currently I've had many discussions with the Environmental Manager for the Otago

region irrigation company about how things can change, one of these changes is going to the board now. I am also on a Resiliant
Community Board. We can set President's cases that show how things can change. We can learn from other's. We can learn from our

community and I think it's essential that we work within our community and support our community so we are all collaborating
towards the same cause and supporting each other within this and towards better solutions. The comments about the irrigation

company are currently being put to the board, so please hold them confidential as they may currently be sensitive information.
However I do think translucency aids support so perhaps soon in the future this information can be released and if it sets a
presidents case, in fact, promoted. But that time is not right now. If you contact me I can keep you up to date with this as if it

becomes a president's case I believe it needs as much support and media and publicity as possible, both to show the way we are
working together for a better future and to align with the industries to create a not just sustainable future, but one where we are

actually fixing what we've damaged in the past. (e.g. our waterways, which is not just health, but respect to Iwi, Culture, Health,
Environment.... many elements.) We can be a leader with respect to changing things for the better. We have the "kiwi" mentality of

making things happen and being innovative. Let's work together to make this Country 100% Pure again!
