While it is important that we act now, it is also very important that we look after the viability of the nation for future generations. Many

of the conversations that have been had have come from the heart where emotion can take control with the talk being about the
need for large quick change. Many do not appreciate the implications that this will bring to many businesses and communities. We

must go through this process using our heads so that we have a carefully planned approach, giving time for adjustment and remain
with sustainable communities into the future. It must be remembered that the overall goal here is for reduced total global emissions.

We are one of the most efficient producers of agriculture product in the world. Any drastic actions which reduced our abilities to
provide this food to the world would likely result in extra production being picked up by a less efficient producing nation and therefore
negatively impact on total global emissions. While agriculture must play it part, science has indicated that we do not need to get to

zero short lived gas emissions to stabilise global temperatures, therefore don't over burden our economy.
