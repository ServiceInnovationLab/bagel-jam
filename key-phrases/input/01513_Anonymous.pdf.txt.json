I believe that passing this bill, and following through on the targets that it sets, are essential for New Zealand's long term wellbeing
and prosperity. If we fail to act on climate change now, we will not get another chance to fix the damage later on. It is not something
that we can address retroactively. We need to set ambitious targets, and we need to achieve them. Because of this, I believe that,

before anything else, this bill needs to be robust. It needs to have impact, and it needs to last. My fear is that successive
governments who may be less comitted to combating climate change than the present government will water it down, or set less

ambitious targets than we need to make a positive impact on our environment. I think that there needs to be some provision to keep
this from happening. Additionally, with all due respect to New Zealand's business community, their interests cannot be allowed to

define this legislation. Targets should take them into account, but must not be subordinate to them. This will only reduce the bill''s
effectiveness, and hamstring any progress we make.
