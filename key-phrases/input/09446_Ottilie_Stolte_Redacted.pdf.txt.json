NZ might be a small player globally, but we have among the highest per capita emissions. We need to take responsibility and reduce
our emissions. Shifting to a low carbon future by reducing emissions should be our main priority. Not trying to find ways to continue

business as usual. We are already seeing serious climate change with only 1 degree of warming so need to act now. A sustainable
low carbon economy and society has so many other benefits to the health of people and the planet. This is the future and we will be

left behind and we risk our international reputation if we stick to intensive methane producing agriculture and a car-dependent
society. The sooner we act the smoother this transition will be.
