This document presupposes that man made Carbon dioxide emissions are the major cause of global warning. Science does not
support this. Action required. Review the "real science" (not mathematical models based on very limited data and are continually

proven wrong by new data) which seems to indicate carbon dioxide levels increase after global warming, not cause it. Have a plan for
NZ to adapt to climate change, address pollution in the form of carbon particles and other gases in the air, swimmable rivers, clean

harbours, plastics recycling, making NZ organic. Carbon dioxide is a colourless odourless gas we all breathe out, not a pollutant. New
Zealand should be leading the world in questioning the science.
