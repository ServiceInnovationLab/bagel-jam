I do not agree with tree planting as an off-setting mechanism. We face catastrophic consequences NOW and trees take decades to
grow. We need to reduce our use and our population. We need brave Governments who will stand up to greed, who will rise taxes
and help up manage the appalling situation we have created for our kids.
