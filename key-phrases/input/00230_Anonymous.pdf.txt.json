See earlier comment about linking carbon emissions to the place of final consumption, especially with regard to our meat and dairy

exports. Food consumed overseas by 40 million people should not be on the heads of 5 million New Zealanders, any more than a
laptop I buy should count against China. See: Druckman, A., & Jackson, T. (2009). The carbon footprint of UK households 1990–2004:
A socio-economically disaggregated, quasi-multi-regional input–output model. Ecological Economics, 68(7), 2066-2077.

on Household Travel Survey statistics for Christchurch that I have analysed, while around half of all trips are within cycling range (6

km), these only make up 15% of the total distance travelled and, therefore, the carbon emissions. Trips over 20 km are less than 10%
of trips but account for nearly half the distance travelled. Cycling is important for health and urban design reasons, but to reduce
carbon emissions, we need to reduce the carbon on *long* and medium length journeys. I can cycle everywhere in town, but one

driving holiday can undo all of those savings. That basically means rail - commuter rail and inter-city passenger rail, as well as for
freight. These options need to be the fastest and cheapest option. If they don't compete on speed and cost, they won't be adopted.

The carbon is in the longer trips, not the easily substitutible short trips.
