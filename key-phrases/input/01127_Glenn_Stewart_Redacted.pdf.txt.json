Every BEV imported into NZ will be fueled from indigenous sources over its lifetime. In contrast, every petrol or diesel vehicle,
including hybrids, will require NZ to continue to import oil to fuel that vehicle over its lifetime. The sooner we get the planned targets
in place, the better off we will be. Investment and business decisions are generally multi-year choices, and the government has

responsibility to provide clear directions across all sectors of the economy. Aggressive targets will need some hard selling, but we can
follow other markets where these signals have already been made. For example, bans on sale of petrol or diesel vehicles after 2040

in the UK and sooner in other countries, getting the power grid to 100% renewables as in Iceland. Incentives and disincentives to
push change will be needed. For example, a surcharge on the sticker price of petrol and diesel fueled vehicles, including hybrids, with
the proceeds to be used to fund charging infrastructure. NZTA to collect the odometer readings at registration time to enable the

calculation of a usage charge to eventually replace fuel taxes. Registration fees to be minimal for BEVs for the first 5 years, while
increasing on a scale for petrol and diesel vehicles.
