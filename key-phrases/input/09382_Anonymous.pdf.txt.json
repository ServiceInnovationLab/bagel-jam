The economy was constructed around oil and gas without accounting for costs of climate change or resource depletion. Either of

 these factors make the consumption of fossil fuels entirely uneconomic now. That's a catastrophic mistake which needs to be
 corrected but where's your transition plan? Banning oil and gas is the right decision but it means shutting down Methenex and Tiwai,
 you need to face that consequence as it impacts many people's lives. There's going to be a huge disruption to the economy and

 jobs won't be replaced. That's an inevitable consequence of increasing technological progress, as jobs are replaced (a good thing)
 unless people take more leisure time there aren't enough jobs to go around. This should be a luxury problem a benefit but we have
 turned it into an economic disaster through inequality. As we have stopped looking for oil and gas in NZ and globally we risk price

 spikes, the next government will simply roll back your plans in the face of these anyway. Only an idealist would believe the
 government can stand against the corporations who own the country. What other businesses will shut down if we are importing
 $12/GJ LNG from under the Pilliga forest via SANTOS? I think this legislation is well intentioned but ineffectual. Lots of highly paid
 useless wafflers without any skin in the game pontificating on what everyone else should do.
