Just want to give some feedback on the legislative changes to support climate change relating to electric vehicles. You might be
 aware of the issues around electric car batteries at present. I have just bought a Nissan Leaf, and am aware that there are no

 batteries presently being imported into the country because the current laws classify them as a dangerous substance. They are
however allowed to be imported when they are inside a car. The lack of replacement batteries is putting a lot of people off buying

Leafs which are all used Japanese imports, particularly the older ones which have less reliable batteries that will need replacement.
We need to change the legislation as soon as possible to support the safe import of refurbished batteries from Japan for our electric

cars. We also need to incentivise car manufacturers to produce batteries in NZ, and support NZ companies that are trying to replicate
these batteries and produce them at home. I hope we can also support the mining of substances used by car batteries that we

currently have available to be mined in NZ, in an environmentally friendly way, and sell these substances or use to develop our own
EV battery industry in NZ. they are in big demand around the world.
