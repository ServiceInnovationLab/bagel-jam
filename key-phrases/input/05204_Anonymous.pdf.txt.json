The background documents are clear and the consultation process is much appreciated. A technical note regarding monitoring the
impact of climate change: attribution of impacts is difficult. Normally thirty years of data is required to determine climate related trends.
However, waiting thirty years to attribute events or damages to climate change versus normal climate variation is impractical and

would not satisfy public and political demands for information on issues such as climate change loss and damage. An alternative
approach could be to allocate events and damages to be climate change related using a balance of evidence approach, then after

sufficient time has elapsed and data accumulated, the allocated events and damages can be attributed (on a robust statistical basis)
and compared with initial allocations. For example, if a heavy precipitation event is consistent with a pattern of climate change then it

might be allocated in part or full as being part of an anthropogenic climate change trend. Similarly the value of damages might also be
allocated to being climate change related based on the weight of evidence. The key to this approach is to update figures once more
time series data becomes available and to assess how accurate allocations appear with time (i.e. it is essential to practice allocations

and get feedback).
