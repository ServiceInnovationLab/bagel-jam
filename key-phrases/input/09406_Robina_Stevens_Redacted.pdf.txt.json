Thank you for the opportunity to submit on this crucial issue. I am a New Zealander, a trained engineer, a trainee doctor, and a
parent, and therefore I cannot exhort you more strongly to put ambitious and importantly, binding strategies in place to reach zero
emissions. I want New Zealand to be a leader on the international stage with regards to our approach. We can inspire other countries,

be on the right side of history, and transform our economy to be more intelligent and sustainable. My training in engineering makes it
clear to me that risks from climate change are real, present and extremely expensive - strong action to prevent climate change and

mitigate its effects are the most environmentally and economically sound response to this massive challenge. Physics does not care
what the ideology of a particular government is, and a strong response to climate change should not be a political issue. I am one

year away from qualifying as a doctor. We know that the effects of climate change on health are going to be increasingly dramatic, with
new diseases and natural disasters causing morbidity and mortality in ways that are currently unknown to New Zealanders. Vulnerable

populations are particularly at risk and thus mitigating climate change is an important part of health equity in an already very unequally
healthy society. Finally, I am desperate for my two young children to inherit a society, economy, and world that is smart, sustainable,
safe, and equitable. I often speak to them about how we elect our leaders to make brave decisions that help us make our societies

better, and I call on you to show true leadership and commit to ambitious, binding targets that we can be proud of. The science
shows us that we have no other option, so let's be ahead of the curve and ride out this challenge in style. With thanks and respect,

Robina Stevens
