The elephant in the room is the farming industry which in NZ contributes 60% to our greenhouse gas emissions and currently is not
included in the ETS. Obviously farming is an important cornerstone to our economy so any change needs to be done in a respectful

and mindful way. Options could include a commitment, in collaboration with the MOH, encouraging vegetable based diets with the
inherent spin-off effects of improved health such as a reduction in heart disease and bowel cancer. Also there could be commitment

to funding R&D into less methane-producing feed for stock and for genetic selection for less gas producing breeds. Another option
is proactive support for changing land use such as converting farms to horticulture or forestry. This could have further benefits on
water and air quality, especially tree planting on waterways.
