Healthy soil can absorb methane via Methantrophs. More works needs to be done here but be very careful on taxing methane from
ruminants. Science will tell us that ruminants are vital to rebuilding topsoil/OM on cropping farms, and storing high levels of carbon on

pasture land. Dung Beetles are crucial for reducing N2O and maybe even methane. Bare soil ie winter cropping is very bad, diverse
forages and better grazing practises without N fertilser is the future. We Extracting fossil fuels are the main problem, so we should be
promoting natural products like wool, hemp etc. We need to use Regenarative farming priniclples that not only improve the

environment, but demand a greater premium of product prices is the future. Synthetic proteins cannot claim that they can improve
our natural resources. Farming is not the problem, it is how we are farming. Photo's below demonstrate some of our different forages

for stock, and harvesting wheat while having N fixing clover underneath and keeps a live plant growing that protects the soil and
requires no N fertilser.
