The government has to take responsibility for reducing greenhouse gas emissions across the board to net zero. It must do this
through: - new legislation to encourage proactivity - funding towards the public transport and environmental sectors - support for at

risk industries - support for those in soon to be reduced industries to find new areas of work and financial stability - sufficient
incentive for innovators to create new and widespread sustainable technologies and business sectors - sufficient incentives for

existing corporate, industrial and agricultural high-emitters to reduce emissions to net zero by 2050 - committing to net zero
emissions by 2050, and protecting this initiative as it is imperative to the survival and long-term wealth and safety of our country -
smart marketing and PR to keep and grow support of the greater public of New Zealand - the creation of a new Ministry for climate

change (or equivalent) to create new roles for experts across numerous related fields to work together on a long term reduction in
emissions (climate change mitigation,) and climate change adaptation which can be put into effect promptly and effectively - the

creation of a climate change commission of diverse experts (equal numbers of male and female, diverse ethnicity, body types and
also inclusive of at least one disabled persons.) - Giving the CCC powers to act, rather than just to advise. The government of New

Zealand must also have more frequent, much better advertised opportunities for submission and advocacy from all members of our
population, as many have missed out this time due to severe lack of outreach.
