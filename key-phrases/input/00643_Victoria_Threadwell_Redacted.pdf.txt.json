On a personal note, I am a Building Scientist (I make buildings more energy efficient as a tool for mitigating climate change) and I have

just had my role made redundant due to the large engineering firm no longer seeing any work in this area. This is really upsetting as
we know NZ's building stock needs serious assistance to become healthier and more energy efficient, and that there needs to be

drastic changed for NZ to reach its emissions targets - yet there is no work in this area in the buildings sector. So, I would love to see
new regulations put in place to make our buildings more energy efficient as a tool for mitigating climate change, as well as healthier.

This will require specialist skills like mine. From my experience this needs to be regulated. We can not rely on the developers or
architects/engineers to make this happen because the majority of people will only do it if they HAVE to. General comments:
Agriculture needs to be targeted, there needs to be mandatory reporting on GHG emissions and targets by each company, as well as

a plan for reaching the targets. Without this, we will not reach our international commitment to the Paris agreement as companies
tend to do the minimum required.
