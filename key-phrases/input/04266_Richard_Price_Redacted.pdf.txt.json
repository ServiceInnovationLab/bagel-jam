While the policy outcomes are very much needed, there is a question on strategic risk oversight. Climate change is recognised

internationally as a National Security threat by many western nations. In that vein, New Zealand should recognise climate change as a
National Security threat and afford it treatments and strategic oversight by the Cabinet National Security Committee and subordinate

officials' committee and watch group(s). As a matter of international representation regarding New Zealand's commitment to the
policy outcomes as proposed, the Bill should prohibit trade negotiations which would either dilute the purpose of this policy objective
or otherwise add to international climate emissions by the other party(s) to a trade agreement. Through this policy objective and

subsequent Bill/legislation, New Zealand must be seen to be a leader in climate change management. This is this generation's
nuclear free moment, and we need to grasp the potential as well as be honest as to the cost as openly and robustly as possible.
