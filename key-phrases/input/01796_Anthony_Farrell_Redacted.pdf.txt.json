The proposed bill is based on the premise that the science is settled and there need be no further scientific discussion to justify it.
That view is not held by many thousands of New Zealanders who have very valid scientific qualifications, who are well educated in

atmospheric physics and climate change matters and who have been monitoring the political dialogue on this issue for many years.
The minister has included statements on weather events in the introduction to the MfE conversation document regarding historical

climate change that are demonstrably incorrect. When questioned he declines to enter into any discussion on these statements. Let
me make it very clear, 'The science is not settled'. The economic impact on New Zealanders of this draconian legislation will be

immense, potentially destroying the livelihood of New Zealanders living in already damaged areas due to the political ideology of a
very small proportion of the population. The government does not have a mandate to force this legislation on the country. It must not
be allowed to proceed without a comprehensive explanation of the scientific evidence and economic impact and a binding

referendum agreeing to support it. A very large number of New Zealanders will not agree that this bill in any form be introduced to
Parliament and submitted for passage into law. The bill must not proceed.
