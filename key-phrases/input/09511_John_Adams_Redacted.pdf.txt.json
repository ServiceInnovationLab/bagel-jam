As will be clear from the comments above - I am concerned that NZ has wasted almost a decade (with significant cumulative

emissions in that time) because politics was allowed to get in the way of science. It is urgently time to turn that around and set up
systems that are distinctly science led. I am concerned that the conversation about co-benefits has not been well explored. At the
presentation in Hawke's Bay (and presumably elsewhere), the idea of land use change was put up as a "challenge" wheras we

already have a number of influential sectors and leaders clamouring for land use change for a wide variety of reasons - notably water
quality & quantity. So land use change should properly go on the "benefits" side of the balance sheet. When we start to actively

consider the co-benefits of some of the proposed actions we see a wide variety of social and environmental gains to add to the GHG
benefits. This tends to encourage us to look at even bolder and more creative solutions. Small changes bring small benefits and

limited alteration to the status quo - conversely, what we are needing is major benefits and profound alterations to the status quo so
we should be looking at the most grand and radical of changes.
