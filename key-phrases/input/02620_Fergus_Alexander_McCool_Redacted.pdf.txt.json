As I have alluded to above, my main concern is that any new rules implemented are going to be focused on the Agriculture industry. I
realise the contribution agri has to our GHG emissions however given the reliance we have on the Agri sector in terms of our GDP,

this has to be expected. Comparing this to other countries is unhelpful as other countries don't have the reliance on commodity
exports like New Zealand does. In the Appendix of the Consultation document under agriculture is states that land use change to

lower emitting uses will likely be needed to achieve material emissions reductions from agriculture. I find this worrying and hope that
no farmer will be forced to change their system. Sure, if there is voluntary land use change that is fine, however forcing reductions
through capping cow numbers etc should not be an option. I know I have stated that I believe too high a reliance is placed on the

planting of trees however this is a key part of reaching our targets. In the appendix under forestry is states that "forestry helps buy us
time until other technological developments or option become available". This already sounds like a Band-Aid solution to a problem.

However, farmers should be able to use techniques such as planting areas and retiring areas as a means of mitigating their
emissions.
