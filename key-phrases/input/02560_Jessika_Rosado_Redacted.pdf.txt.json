This summer I was aware of a variety of sea shells on the shore. I marvelled at the intricacy and beauty of these natural treasures.

Later I learned that the water temperature was causing the shell fish to die. How depressing! It made me wonder what species we will
lose to global warming. I hope it is not too late to save the inhabitants of our waters and lands. They are truly taonga. I hope New

Zealand will live up to its pure reputation, which it does not currently deserve.
