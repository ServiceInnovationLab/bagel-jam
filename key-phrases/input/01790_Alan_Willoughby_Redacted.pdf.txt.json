I've made a few as I went through. The most important one is that before this Bill is even discussed, there should be a very thorough

examination of unbiased research to see if, in fact, climate change is being driven by human activities. Two questions must be asked
and answered: 1. If the climate changes rapidly in the other direction, i.e. it begins cooling as it has over the past few years, what will
be the response of the government? Maybe to burn oil to produce more CO2? 2. If climate keeps on changing, will that mean that we

will require a less than zero carbon Bill? What will be the government's response when they find, as they will, that regardless of what
they do, the climate continues to do its own thing? No, you won't have thought of these and certainly won't want to think of them in

your idealised, we're in control of everything world. Anyway, I'm just an elderly earth scientist - what would I know? It's my kids and
grandkids I feel sorry for with governments taking the attitude that the present one is with this Bill.
