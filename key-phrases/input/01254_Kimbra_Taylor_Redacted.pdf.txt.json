I see that your current policy on woodsmoke is very thin. The only low emission woodburners on the market are the Pyro Classic and

pellet burners, which emit carbon dioxide ( a climate change gas). All other so called 'low emsission burners' are dependent on
correct burning to emit only carbon dioxide. Once people lose a bright rolling flame, the box cools, the wood smoulders and high

levels of smoke are produced. It is impossible to maintain a hot burning rolling flame consistently, no one has the level of attention to
do that. So in fact the 'low emission burners being advertised by the industry are not. They are as polluting as the old ones over their

lifetime. There is a misconception that dry wood does not produce smoke. Anything that is burned produces toxic smoke - tobacco,
wood, oil...
