Be legendary. Be heroes. Get on with it. We need a net-zero carbon future for all. I feel that the F&B submission nails it all for me - see
below: We need to make dramatic reductions in our emissions to keep climate change limited to 1.5 degrees and ensure our
precious native plants and animals are protected. Nature is our taonga and we cannot exist without it. We must act together. The key

things I support in a Zero Carbon Act are: A target for net-zero carbon emissions by 2040 should be in the Act. The emissions from
transport, industrial activity, agriculture, and all other sources should be included in the target. Even ‘short-lived’ gasses can have a

huge effect on our climate and need to be reduced. Emissions budgets should be at least as important as fiscal budgets, and the
Government should set plans to achieve them. An independent Climate Change Commission of experts should monitor emissions

and give advice to keep New Zealand on-track for its emissions reduction goals.
