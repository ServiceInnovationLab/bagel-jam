Man-made climate change has simply been assumed to be true without a rigorous, impartial scientific debate. Claiming that the
'scientific community' has reached consensus is simply wrong, especially when skeptics are pushed off the media platform. The real

question is whether or not we should make any laws about carbon dioxide at all. Consequently, the great majority of these questions
are really quite irrelevant to the reality of the situation. Please just halt the zero carbon bill as it is, put it aside, and use the money to
provide warm, dry, securing housing for the most destitute New Zealanders and their families.
