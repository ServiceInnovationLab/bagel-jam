Biggest issue is transitioning to a neutral emissions target that includes EVERYONE. It is likely to affect everyone in every sector. Be it
private citizens, industry, agriculture, tourism, transport, etc. everyone has a role to play and contribute. I think transport is something
that has the most potential for improvement for people from a wide range of sectors. More freight transported by rail, increased

patronage on public transport or bike, reducing the number of vehicles in New Zealand are potential transport goals to aim for.
