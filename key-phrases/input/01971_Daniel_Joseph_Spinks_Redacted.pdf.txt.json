There are so many easy things we should be ticking off. Target solar incentives in areas where fossil fuels are burned. More wind
energy. Incentives for farmer to plant forest on less productive land and even along side paddocks. Use prisons for tree nurseries

which would teach prisoners valuable life skills, Use community service to plant trees. Continue to tax fuel but make NZ an easy place
to buy electric cars. Speed up use of technology in cars so that driving on Motorways and highways is taken over by computers.

Traffic jams would be a thing of the past. Continue with Trams and electric trains but make sure they are a cheap alternative. We must
also try to move to a more circular economy with our waste. Allow travellers to NZ to offset their carbon foot print (Voluntarily) but it will
help show we are starting to live up to our 100% pure image. Stop farming in areas like the Mackenzie basin. I have no problem with

our farming industry if we can start to do it more sustainably.
