  "There is a clear divide between how the environment should be valued between New Zealanders. This is reflected in the varying\nattitudes that individual MPs and Ministers have towards specific Environmental and Climate Change policies. In order to successfully\n\nreach the goal of being carbon neutral by 2050, it is absolutely necessary that the philosophy of sustainability is integrated into every\nMinistry and Department. If the introduction to Climate Change legislation is not introduced holistically, there may be a possible risk of\n\nconflicting ideology between the Climate Change Commission and other government entities. Progressing towards a carbon neutral\neconomy is highly beneficial towards contemporary New Zealand society. With untouched natural landscapes as the main attraction,\n\ntourism is one of the largest industries in New Zealand. There is a significant importance towards the Government to endorse the\nmost up to date Environmental Policy in order to maintain the quality of destinations to both domestic and international visitors.\nEradicating the dependence on a fossil fuel economy will also allow greater national self sufficiency, and localised industries. This is\n\nhighly important for an isolated country developing in an economy with ever diminishing resources.",

  "What ever is set, it must be based on science, please refer to your document. Any target we set needs to be informed by the best\n\navailable climate change science. Nearly half of New Zealand’s greenhouse gas emissions come from agriculture, which means we\nneed to pay particular attention to the scientific impact of short-lived gases like methane, which dominate agriculture’s emissions.\n\nSHORT-LIVED AND LONG-LIVED GASES Short-lived gases like methane decay relatively rapidly in the atmosphere. They last for\ndecades rather than centuries. This means global temperatures can be stabilised without necessarily reducing emissions of these\ngases to zero. We also have an opportunity to lower the impact even further by not only stabilising but also, where possible, reducing\n\nshort-lived gases from our economy. Long-lived gases like carbon dioxide either need to reduce entirely to zero or at least to the\npoint where emissions can be balanced out by an equal amount of removals.",
  "Zero Carbon Bill Submission First of all I'd like to point out that compared with many other, if not all, \"developed\" countries, it is dead\neasy for NZ to reach zero carbon. It has but 4million people, a temperate, relatively amenable (for the time being) climate, an\n\nelectricity sector 80% or so renewable, a population not averse to bucking the trend (nuclear free) and a new government, for the\ntime being, that has shown itself willing to tackle climate change. Unfortunately it also has a fiscally responsible, essentially neoliberal\ngovernment, an economy dependant on exports and international trade, an agricultural and transport sector that is dependant on\n\nCO2 emitting fossil fuels and a society that in the last 40 years or so has shown one of the greatest increases in disparity between\nthe rich and the poor in the \"developed\" world. So there's a fair bit for a Zero Carbon Act or more pertinently, the Climate Commission,\n\nto deal with. But it's a good start and I support the idea. With the following caveats, conditions and considerations. 1. 2050 is too late.\n2040 is marginal. 2030, if not earlier is necessary to meet the Paris agreement's optimistic, 1.5C warming target. Surely NZ signed up\n\nto this? Albeit on a voluntary basis? 2. Essentially emissions have to be reduced, not offset. Yes, planting trees is essential but short\nterm havestable commercial forestry is not the answer and carbon credits are nothing but a trendy, acceptable form of colonisation;\n\nexport of the problem to a less fortunate part of the world. If not financial skullduggery. 3. Reduction of emissions means that we have\nto change our economy and lifestyle. Sorry you electric car owners but one flight to Auckland for a conference or a Big Day Out\nundoes all the savings from a year of Leaf commuting. The Zero Carbon Act/Climate Commission must not start by assuming that we\n\ncan maintain our \"standard\" of living while reducing our emissions. 4. But at the same time, it must ensure that our poorer citizens are\nlooked after. There's a lot of carbon emissions our well off, dare I say, middle class, citizens can forego poor things and stay alive and\n\nbugger all those living in the likes of South Dunedin on nigh on zero hour contracts and the benefit pittance can. Social Justice I think\nit's called, if you want an acceptable term rather than ill health and early death. 5. Zero carbon by 20** requires serious consideration\n\nof the re-localisation of the economy. Local food, local industry. Reduction of reliance on international trade, transport, multinational\ncorporations, financial dealings. The reversal of the neoliberal agenda of the past 50 years has to be on the agenda. 6. So who is\ngoing to be on the Climate Commission? The body that steers NZ to Zero Carbon? Our major export earners? Fonterra - methane,\n\ncoal? Tourism -aviation fuel? Federated farmers - methane, diesel? Ex National Party politicians? This is not a forum for excusing the\nstatus quo but one for coming up with the answers. Quickly. Necessary are: climate scientists to remind us of and update the\n\nproblem. economists (for want of a better word) to provide alternatives to the present neoliberal hegemony and the doers, those\nwho are already part of the solution, those who have demonstrated a competence in sustainable energy, local food, electric transport\n\netc. (Not lobby groups). We want a direct path to the future for our children and the world, not one littered with hurdles and ditches\nconstructed by those with vested interests in the status quo. 7. So what power/influence should the Climate Commission have over\n\nGovernment? It is after all an unelected body. Perhaps here we should consider the role of the (unelected) Treasury and M.B.I. on\ngovernment policy? The treasury has unquestionably had a role in the neoliberal stance of government and MBI has been touring the\ncountry of late promoting the old and new Trans Pacific Trade Partnership with scant regard for its relevance to the Paris agreement..\n\nConsiderable power has been quietly given to or assumed by these bodies over public policy. So why not the Climate Commission?\nThere's a precedent and the impending consequences are somewhat dire. Should the politicians in government be obliged to\n\naccept and implement the Commission's recommendations or will it be voluntary and will they only do so if they are of the climate\ncrisis rather than climate denier persuasion or can get some electoral advantage? 8. As a pinko leftie, all too aware of the dangers of\n\ndictators yet with any remnant belief in democracy compromised by US elections, I'm wary of placing policy decisions in the hands of\nanyone, let alone a few appointees. However, if the Commission is so constituted as to come up with informed, well reasoned\nrecommendations based on the latest science and research, then I think it has to have considerably more status than an advisory\n\nbody. Informed opinions are our best hope.",
  "Yes. As Generation Zero suggests, this reporting power will: \"• Provide information to better enable the Government to understand\nthe scope of climate change risks and plan accordingly. • Incentivise organisations to devote their own resources to developing high-\n\nquality adaptation plans. These reports are beneficial to the organisations themselves. The first round of reporting under the UK Act\ntriggered organisational change in 78% of reporting authorities, including the embedding of climate risk and adaptation issues.64 It\nalso led to many organisations considering climate risks for the first time, and provided the impetus for organisations to plan to\n\nassess climate risks in the future. • Promote positive flow-on effects to other organisations by providing ‘good practice’ examples of\nhow to assess and address climate risks. This can lead to cross-sector information networks for sharing adaptation risk.",
  "Threat of climate change needs credible mitigation plans and actions to seriously reduce GHG emissions, and achieving the Paris\n\nAgreement’s aim to keeping \"global temperature rise well below 2 degrees Celsius” requires moving to zero emissions of carbon\ndioxide.

We also miss out on the many benefits and opportunities of early adapting. The world is\nchanging, rapidly. We need to look at what we are doing to our planet and how we adapt to the future state. The Zero Carbon Act will\n\nhelp us safely adapt to the effects of New Zealand’s changing climate. It will drive for our rapidly advancing world. Technology and\ninnovation, changing how we do business and the funding models, optimising resources, collaboration and co-operation, making\nsmarter decisions will all deliver a resilient low carbon future.

  "As will be clear from the comments above - I am concerned that NZ has wasted almost a decade (with significant cumulative\n\nemissions in that time) because politics was allowed to get in the way of science. It is urgently time to turn that around and set up\nsystems that are distinctly science led. I am concerned that the conversation about co-benefits has not been well explored. At the\npresentation in Hawke's Bay (and presumably elsewhere), the idea of land use change was put up as a \"challenge\" wheras we\n\nalready have a number of influential sectors and leaders clamouring for land use change for a wide variety of reasons - notably water\nquality & quantity. So land use change should properly go on the \"benefits\" side of the balance sheet. When we start to actively\n\nconsider the co-benefits of some of the proposed actions we see a wide variety of social and environmental gains to add to the GHG\nbenefits. This tends to encourage us to look at even bolder and more creative solutions. Small changes bring small benefits and\n\nlimited alteration to the status quo - conversely, what we are needing is major benefits and profound alterations to the status quo so\nwe should be looking at the most grand and radical of changes.",
  "There are real risks around unintended consequences from this type of legislation, and also from other responses to climate change.\n\nFor example, an immediate 60% reduction in GHGs emitted through the production of industrial heat in the South Island could be\nachieved if gas supplies were found in the South Island to replace coal, but inexplicably, that option has been taken away by\n\npreventing future exploration for gas. NZ's electricity network is still reliant on burning coal on cold frosty still winter's nights when\nneither solar nor wind can produce power, and our hydro-generation capacity cannot carry the entire network load. This situation has\n\nat least in part developed because of the Resource Management Act, because no large-scale hydro dams have been consented\nsince the RMA came into effect - a classic example of intended consequences, as the RMA was in theory designed to protect our\nenvironment, but has in practice led to a continuation of coal being burnt to generate electricity. The most likely scenario from the\n\nZero Carbon bill seems to be that households will have to bear the high capital cost of storage batteries in their homes in order to\nhave a reliable electricity supply, the total capital cost of which will be much higher than the alternative form of storage (lakes behind\n\nlarge dams).

  "Well done on finally (finally!) setting up this piece of legislation. It is desperately needed and it needs multi-party support. We all know\nhow important this issue is. One thing that has been left out is the need somewhere, somehow, to account for consumption-based\n\nemissions. There are currently gaps globally in the areas of international air travel and shipping, but more importantly, we need to\navoid a situation whereby developed (or other) countries offshore most of their production and their citizens still continue to buy\nproducts with high embedded emissions. Of course the idea is that China and other countries will be limited by their own emission\n\ntargets, but there is a genuine danger that it could spiral out of control, and indeed many say it already has.

  "The concept outline below suggests constructive ideas as to how and why carbon is far more important than just climate change -\n\nand ways to achieve that. ShelterForest: - A solution for some of the most critical challenges facing mankind in the 21st century:\nSignificant elements: - Climate change, costs, consequences, and carbon implications; ShelterForest outlined; Global topsoil\n\ndegeneration and implications; Opportunities from trees and shelter; Ramial chipped wood - an answer to sequestration and soil\ndegeneration; Hydraulic redistribution – a previously unrecognised quality of many trees; The imperative to include shelter in carbon\n\ncalculations; Introduction: Our planet is in the process of exceeding its capacity to support the rampantly expanding human\npopulation and the demands from increasing consumerism. Major challenges include climate change, loss of topsoil, and,\nincreasingly challenged water resources, - factors all addressed by ShelterForest. Climate change currently has a significant political\n\nprofile. Calculations suggest the current annual global cost of climate change at US$140 billion although, given global climatic events\nduring Aug/Sept 2017, this figure might be dramatically understated. Financial, economic and loss of life costs can be expected to\n\nincrease exponentially in line with recent trends. The most immediate response to global warming is to reduce levels of atmospheric\nCO2. The pragmatic way of achieving this is by the planting of trees. Unfortunately, planting forests also conflicts with increasing\n\ndemands for food – or do they? ShelterForest (SF) accommodates this conflict by proposing planting large numbers of trees in ways\nwhich increase land productivity, reduce the impact of climate change, and provide additional opportunities and benefits. The\nconcept: ShelterForest proposes planting of 20% of all land in trees in the form of shelter belts of some 20 metre or so width. Shelter\n\nbelts thus become belts of forest rather than single lines of trees by growing several rows (say 3) of harvestable lumber trees inter-\nplanted with understory plants, all chosen for multiple purposes and functions, including rotational harvest. The shelter value of the\n\nplantings alone will more than compensate for the land taken out of production in most, if not all, situations. These benefits will be\neven more significant with the advent of increasingly extreme weather predicted by global warming. While a primary objective of\n\nShelterForest is to combat the causes and consequences of climate change, the most immediate benefit will be in the economic\nvalue of shelter will begin within months of being planted and grow rapidly thereafter. Growing trees sequester carbon, both through\n\ntheir own biomass and into the surrounding soils, thus contributing to soil regeneration. In addition, there are other benefit\nopportunities with profound implications including environmental, economic and sustainability. ShelterForest design process: SF is\nachieved through a design process considering a complex range of factors, possibilities, and outputs. All farmland should be\n\nincluded, especially productive flats and ‘easy’ land. The starting point for each site would be an in-depth analysis of relevant factors\nincluding geology, geography, prevailing winds, sun orientation, climate, existing structures including established trees, waterways\n\netc. Plant selection would consider plant functions, characteristics, their relationship with each other and the environment as well as\nresource, harvest, and other considerations. Such might include the use of deciduous trees to enable sun penetration during winter\n\nand early spring months whilst retaining significant shelter function. Understory shrubs would provide livestock protection against\nadverse weather during winter. The Value of Shelter: The economic benefits of shelter are all too often little recognised. A passage\nwas noted in an American journal a number of years ago which suggested: - If you plant 20% of your land in trees, productivity on the\n\nremaining 80% will increase by 80%. This was more recently reinforced by the reported experience at Windwhistle – a name inspired\nby environmental circumstances - in Canterbury, NZ - where it was observed that when shelter was planted “productivity increased\n\nby more than 60%”. These observations suggest that the productivity value of shelter alone in most situations will provide gains well\nin excess of any perceived loss of production from the area planted in trees. Shelter is an essential part of many permanent crops. It\nseems likely that for most, if not all other farming activities, the economic value of shelter is little understood and/or has not been fully\n\nevaluated. The mechanics of shelter: The immediate value of shelter is reduced wind. Within the zone immediately behind shelter,\nwind speed is reduced by about 80%. At a distance 10 times the vertical height of the shelter, wind speed will be reduced in the\n\norder of 30% to 50%. Thus, shelter of height 30m will have significant downwind benefits for more than 300m, coincidentally also\nbenefiting the next ShelterForest belt. Reduced wind means reduced stress on both animals and plants and reduced loss of water\n\nfrom evaporation. Wind-chill increases the energy (food) requirement of livestock and can have particularly devastating, even fatal\nconsequences, particularly when accompanied by cold rain. Heat can also be a source of stress which can be accentuated by direct\nsun and by high temperature winds (the other end of the wind-chill factor). Skin temperatures on dark animals have been measured\n\nupwards of 50oC. Trees beyond shelter: Trees have been critical to the development of life on planet Earth. They have been integral\nto the development of man since he began using fire and making tools. Today they are still essential for many building structures and\n\nindustries and provide a huge biomass resource which is also a natural alternative to many fossil resource requirements, Many trees\nhave extraordinary value as livestock fodder - nutrition and health from leaves, twigs, bark, and fruits, - food for bees (an increasingly\n\nthreatened element of reliable food supply), food and environmental support for wildlife and natural predators etc. They are essential\nfor erosion control on steep hills and along river banks. A significant aspect of SF is that, through the design process, mature trees\ncan be harvested on a rotational basis with minimal impact on the functional integrity of the shelter. Slash from harvested trees can\n\nbe an energy or alternative biomass resource, and/or, chipped as a resource for regenerating topsoil (see RCW below). Many leaves,\nand even the bark from some trees are highly nutritious and naturally sought after by livestock. The harvest and by-products from SF\n\nwill provide new economic and sustainability opportunities for the land and its owners as well as increased opportunities for\nmeaningful employment. Carbon sequestration: Estimates suggest that about 30% of the current excess carbon in the atmosphere\n\noriginated from degrading soils. Trees naturally sequester carbon. Climate change is a serious challenge and but soil degeneration\nmay be an even more critical. We need to return carbon to the soil for the regeneration of organic biomass and soil fertility. As soon as\n\ntrees begin to grow they accumulate carbon from the atmosphere, both below and above ground. It has now been shown that\ncarbon levels in the ground increase as you get closer to trees, likely through natural leaf and twig litter and other biological\nprocesses. Most of the world’s fertile topsoils were formed by natural forest litter. Satellite technology can now measure every\n\nsignificant tree canopy on the planet. It is particularly important that these are all recognised as every ton of C is relevant, especially if\nwe (the tax payer) are paying for carbon credit deficits. Every tree contributes to carbon sequestration and long-term sustainability.\n\nThe soil resource (or deficit): The soils of the world are being degraded at an alarming rate with loss of soil biomass (carbon) a major\nfactor. University of Sydney Professor John Crawford says that current projections of topsoil degradation suggest that within the next\n\n50 years our planet will produce 30% less food with a population demanding 50% more. This equates to a projected food deficit in\nthe order of 50%. Trees, particularly in the form of ShelterForest, provide an extraordinary answer to this dilemma, in part through the\npotential of Ramial Chipped Wood: Ramial Chipped Wood (RCW): < http://forestgeomat.for.ulaval.ca/brf > Research began at Laval\n\nUniversity, Quebec, in the late 1970s as a result of large piles of slash left after logging operations. Over 20 years of research\nproduced positive, if not astounding, results with two in particular illustrating the potential; strawberries in Quebec and tomatoes in\n\nSenegal producing yield increases of 300% and 1000% respectively. Fertile topsoil is a critical ingredient for high yielding crops.\nThroughout evolution plants and trees have been essential to the formation of topsoil. We now have the understanding and the\n\ntechnology to dramatically enhance this natural process and begin to repair the damage done by global deforestation and modern\nfarming practices. Perhaps the greatest opportunity from RCW is to sequester carbon into soil in a process which could have\n\nprofound implications for the lives of billions of people within the next generation or so. Mobile technology is already available which\ncan chip trees at up to 90 tons/hr - the limiting factor being access to raw tree material. This equates to 180,000 tonnes every year\nfor each chipping unit. With SF, such material would be grown and processed on site eliminating most transportation and further\n\nprocessing costs. Another opportunity arising from this concept is that lower grade RCW+, (RCW is defined as having a diameter less\nthan 7cm) could be chipped by the same equipment, either as a bulk resource (such as energy) or as an expanded resource of\n\nwoodchip for sequestration. RCW offers a process which enables recovery from the massive global deforestation over recent history\nand subsequent soil degeneration by providing organic material to regenerate topsoils and enhance land productivity. Composting is\n\nlong considered a fundamental of good gardening. (It is the natural process of forest litter.) RCW expands that concept to a new level\nof practicable possibility. The place for trees today is as an integral part of all conventional farming rather than, or as well as,\nconventional forestry. Water: In addition to reduced evaporation resulting from shelter, increased biomass in soils will further benefit\n\nwater challenges by increasing the water absorption and retention. This should be of special interest in the light of anticipated\nincreasing weather extremes from global warming. Organic soil matter can hold 20 times its own weight in water. Hydraulic\n\nRedistribution: This is an extraordinary quality recognised in a report from UC Berkeley in 2005. Upwards of 60 tree species were\nrecognised as ‘dumping’ water at the bottom of their roots at wet times and releasing it back into surface soils during dry times. This\n\nhas the benefit of alleviating stress on the plants during both flood and drought. Back to the future: Mention the concept of planted\nforests and the immediate thought is of large areas of single specie trees. This continues the modern experiment of mono-culture\n\nwhich clearly challenges our planet’s natural evolutionary biology. SF invites a revisit of the concept of ‘forest’ and consideration\ntowards more natural integrated biological systems. These will prove to be more productive, much more sustainable and less risky\nthan the intensive monocultural farming methods which currently prevail. ShelterForest will, at planting, begin the many and complex\n\ncontributions to a more viable and sustainable future, contributions which will grow year by year. Marcus Williams",

IF .. the temperature has gone up 1 C over the last 100+ years for ANY reason, then the AVERAGE Humidity would have gone up by\n\nabout 400ppm while CO>2 went up by say 120ppm, so water vapour affects are 3X those of CO>2 {see attached]. A KEY POINT: IF\nthere is even NO CHANGE in temperature, and the Humidity goes UP by 2% or 5% >>> then that INCREASE in Water Vapour is far\n\nMORE than the increase in CO>2 over 100 years!! And Humidity changes over just a few minutes!! [See Attached]",

  "Refrigerants - New Zealand’s Climate Denial. Small amounts but significant due to potency. Example of legislation nobody paying\n\nattention to. If we are to reduce greenhouse gases why in NZ so poor on refrigerants? The irony of people wringing their hands over\nemissions yet nobody seems concerned over the fridge unless it fails to keep the chardy cool. When it fails the fridge is dumped,\n\ngases released. Yes, yes there is a law that says such gases are not to be released into the atmosphere but like so many\nenvironmental laws in NZ, few pay attention. (Even councils regularly flout the Reserves Act.) For if there is no enforcement it is as\n\ngood as no law at all. So let’s forget about announcing the edicts that cause no change and actually figure out a way to stop\nrefrigerants being released from discarded fridges, air conditioning units, dehumidifiers, heat pumps etc At present companies that\nrun transfer stations allow the dumping of fridges into scrap metal piles. They ask that they are dumped on condition that they have\n\nbeen ‘de-gassed’. For a start that is not always checked and if it is, and found intact, the dumper is asked to de-gas. The most\ncommon response is the dumper to simply cut the refrigerant line. The company running the transfer station then can claim it is the\n\nresponsibility of the dumper and wash their hands but it results in the same thing. It is free to dump a fridge as the metal is recycled.\nThe dump operator gets free metal out of the deal. Fridges make up a very large proportion of that scrap metal pile. Perhaps the\n\nanswer is to require transfer station operators to have a role in recycling the gases and for the polluter to pay. To dump a fridge with\ngas will cost something to recover that gas but it should cost significantly more to dump a fridge with the refrigerant line cut. Yes,\nthere are refrigeration companies that de-gas fridges but it has been known that people pay for such a service only to discover the\n\ncompany has simply snipped the line out of convenience. All fridges etc end up at the dump so why not concentrate recovery there?\nHow to get transfer station operators, that to me seem very disinterested in recycling, to carry out recovery? The pit seems cheaper\n\nand more convenient for so much waste. I fear it might have to be a case of forcing operators to have a system in place that can\neasily be monitored and audited if they want fridge metal. Will this result in them not accepting items at all and promote fly tipping?\nLeast then it will be an issue that is open as opposed to what exists in NZ now which is a total denial. I brought a dehumidifier the\n\nother day but nowhere on the machine or in the manual did it list the refrigerant. So obviously the manufacturer doesn’t even think\nthe gas will be recycled. The store selling me the dehumidifier had no idea. An end of life recovery bounty system financed at the\n\npoint of sale would have worked here. But we really don’t care. We say we do, but it’s like buying a plastic dolphin to show how much\nyou care about the sea. There is a connection in people’s head but not in reality. Fridge dumping really does seem an issue we have\n\nseriously overlooked in the plethora of Climate Change mission statements. I look forward to the day NZ gets real on hazardous\nmaterials (well behind the OECD on that) and actually monitors what we are doing as a country. Choosing to take a bag to the\nsupermarket is not going to do it. Please consider gases used in rolling out more heat pumps etc. What is the end point?",

  "A Zero Carbon Act is important to me because I want my children to know what fish tastes like, live in an environment where food is\nnot scarce, and where they don't have to fight for food or water to survive. I want my kids to know we did everything we could to avoid\n\nclimate change, which is irreversible and brings with it a huge burden of adaptation (mostly for our food supply and delicate\necosystem which has never experienced such a speed of change). The impacts of climate change cannot be un-done, and become\n\nexponential over time. A couple of degrees is too much for earth to sustain our current lifestyle. We are already experiencing 1\ndegree warmer temperature (vs pre-industrial levels) with another degree likely to be ‘baked in’. This may seem small, but there was\nonly a 3 degree average temperature change in the central point between the ice ages and Jurassic period. I realise NZ relies heavily\n\non the dairy industry for our GDP, but we are a smart and resourceful nation. With the right incentives and clear direction we will be\nable to mititgate Methane or diversify our land use while still maintaining a strong economy. This will only happen with clear direction\n\nfrom the government – clarifying our commitment to be net zero on emissions. It’s great all Kiwis have the opportunity to input to this\ndecision, however – I hope the specialists in this area make the final decision smartly. Most kiwis do not have the time/energy to read\n\nall the research and understand the significance and urgency of the changes needed. We need the current government to make the\nright decision for us in the long-term. You are the ones that have the information and have the opportunity now to make a significant\nchange. Hopefully the bravest decision is made. There may not be another opportunity for this government to show it is bold and\n\nbrave and putting the long term health of kiwis first. Also - If the Government sets a 2050 target now, it should set the most ambitious\ntarget: reducing total greenhouse gases to net zero by 2050. If you are wanting to treat short-term and long-term gasses differently.\n\nThen surely you should also treat gasses that are more-potent (and heat up the planet more) differently to those that are less-\npotent. For example, Methane heats up the planet 25 times more than Carbon Dioxide. Nitrous Oxide heats up the planet 298 times\n\nmore than Carbon dioxide. Why would you consider length of time but not potency? 1) We must include Methane in the target:\nMethane heats up the planet 25 times more than Carbon Dioxide*. Methane only lasts in the atmosphere for 12 years (instead of\n\nCO2 which lasts for hundreds or thousands). But if the objective is to minimise/reduce climate change, we should look at alternatives\nto reduce methane quickly. We can't afford to continue Methane emissions at current levels as they are the most damaging in the\nshort-term - which is the critical time. We have a booming dairy industry, but that industry is contributing towards the natural weather\n\ncatastrophes that will end up causing it to fail. It would be better to be pro-active now and deploy ways to mitigate the impact of\nMethane. Some may argue NZ is a small % of global emissions (0.17%). This is true, but NZ is seen globally as a test market and if we\ncan demonstrate to the world how we can reduce emissions from Agriculture, then bigger markets (with more global impact) will\n\nfollow. We need to lead with a bold and brave ambition and actions. 2) Mitigate Methane in Agriculture using: a. Anaerobic Digestion -\nwhich enables farmers to convert methane into biomethane which can be used as a renewable energy source for fuel, heating,\n\nelectricity etc. This is successfully used in UK and other markets. b. Methane inhibitors to reduce/delete methane from livestock.\nThere has already been good movement forward in this area in NZ, but we need to move faster. Can we increase funding to speed\nup research results and make commercial Methane inhibitors available more widely as well as education. 3) We must include Nitrous\n\nOxide in the target. Nitrous Oxide heats up the planet 298 times more than Carbon Dioxide*. 4) Mitigate Nitrous Oxide in Agriculture\nusing: a. Gibberellins, natural hormones that stimulate plant growth and could be used in pastures instead of nitrogen fertiliser (which\n\ncurrently creates nitrous oxide emissions). 5) Diversity land use from dairy to horticulture or other uses. 6) Off-set overall emissions by\nplanting more trees. *Source: Our atmosphere and climate 2017 report.

Trips over 20 km are less than 10%\nof trips but account for nearly half the distance travelled. Cycling is important for health and urban design reasons, but to reduce\ncarbon emissions, we need to reduce the carbon on *long* and medium length journeys. I can cycle everywhere in town, but one\n\ndriving holiday can undo all of those savings. That basically means rail - commuter rail and inter-city passenger rail, as well as for\nfreight.

  "Ever since I was a spotty Geography student at Linwood High School in ChCh in the mid 1980s, doing my research project of particle\n\nemissions in ChCh's infamous winter smog, the problems of pollution & it's adverse affect on humanity & the environment, it's been\npretty bloody evident that we need change. Going on to do a Geography degree at Canty Uni, studying under some of NZ's most\npreeminent scholars in the area of Climate Change & human impact on the environment, the clear message in the late 1980s was\n\nwe were already too late to save us from ourselves. Honestly, 40 years later, that we are still having this 'debate' it beggars belief. But\nthen after nearly a decade of belittling science & academics (re the disgusting personal attacks on the likes of Dr Mike Joy), I can see\n\nhow we are at this point. We need RADICAL change. In my humble, but educated opinion, we are too late to the party, but better late\nthan never. Whatever we can do to make this process faster (yet scientifically rigorous), the better. I'm in awe of places like University\n\nof British Columbia, where I am fortunate to have lived 5x since 1999, which has these goals already in place (some time ago).

  "Over recent years livestock farming, and in particular dairy farming, has come in for major criticism as the leading source of green\nhouse gas emissions in New Zealand. At its most basic level there may be a modicum of truth to this assertion. However I would\n\ncontend that in terms of animal emissions farming is already close to carbon neutral. To understand this assertion we must go back\nto first principles. From my earliest days of third form general science I was taught the Law of the Conservation of Matter, which states\nthat matter can neither be created nor destroyed. It can however change its state. What this means in its simplest terms is that there\n\nis no more carbon in the total environment now than there ever was; and if there is more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere now than\nyears ago we need to ascertain where it has come from. From a livestock perspective an animal can put out no more carbon in its\n\nproducts, milk meat fibre, or digestive end products, than it ingests in its feed. So an animal takes up nutrients in its forage; carbon,\nhydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen etc. and reconfigures them into different end products, but the net sum is zero. University academics\n\ncan put the fancy names to processes but the truth of the matter is that everything in nature is cyclical, and in the case of carbon the\nmechanism is photosynthesis. This, incidentally, is the same process whereby trees recycle carbon and take it out of the\nenvironment. In agriculture the system is balanced. The forage animals live on grows by photosynthesis, and other cyclical pathways,\n\nwhereby products are removed from the environment, the animals eat the forage and emit it in one form or another. Soil micro-\norganisms also play a major role in this process. If there was no recycling the whole system would have collapsed centuries ago and\n\nhumanity would have died from starvation. Furthermore, in addition to the forage farmers are growing which is incidentally taking\ngreen house gases from the atmosphere, they are also making a huge contribution by planting farm forestry, riparian strips and\n\nshelter belts. Therefore, I submit that animal emissions should not be included in the equation for green house gas calculations. So if\nthe net emissions are not coming from farming the question is, where do they come from; and the most obvious source is\n\ncombustion of fossil fuels which have been locked out of the biosphere for millennia but are now being reintroduced over time. I\nacknowledge that the farming sector uses its share of these fuels and contend that farmers are prepared to make their fair\ncontribution towards mitigating the effects of these as is appropriate. This view will be unpalatable to the general public because for\n\nyears the news media has painted farmers as ecological villains. It is now time for a proper education process to explain why\nagriculture will not be included in the Carbon Zero equation.",

The key things we support in a Zero Carbon Act are: • an ambitious Act that follows\n\nthe climate science by covering all gases across all sectors • a target of net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2040 • an Act that\ntargets the emissions from transport, industrial activity, agriculture and all other sources • an Act that includes emissions budgets\n\nthat should be at least as important as fiscal budgets, with plans set by the Government to achieve these budget • well publicised\nrobust interim milestones for government departments and NZ as a whole • an independent Climate Change Commission of experts\nto monitor emissions and give advice to the Government to keep New Zealand on track for its emissions reduction goals. We support\n\nZero Carbon Act legislation that establishes the goal of limiting warming to 1.5 degrees. We should not settle for 2 degrees warming.\nAny higher limit than 1.5 degrees would result in devastating impacts for Pacific Island states and significant extinctions. That is not\n\nacceptable. To give us the best possibility of achieving no more than 1.5 degrees warming by the end of the century, we must start\nmaking rapid cuts in all greenhouse gas emissions now. We support a net-zero target of 2040, with the majority of cuts occurring\n\nover the next decade. We support all greenhouse gases being included in the law, consistent with international climate frameworks.\nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) clearly states that methane reduction is critical to succeeding in tackling\n\nclimate change. Our climate law must include all greenhouse gases, including those from our biggest emitting sector - the\nagricultural sector. We support setting a gross emissions reduction target as well as a net emissions reduction target. We cannot rely\non planting trees alone to offset our emissions. We must seek to decarbonise our industry and transport systems. As the\n\nParliamentary Commissioner for the Environment stated in their submission to the Productivity Commission, June 2018, page 4: “Each\ntonne of emissions offset by forestry is a tonne not reduced at source. Relying too heavily on forestry could lead to continued high\n\nlevels of gross emissions. Pressure to reduce these after 2050 could entail a more costly and disruptive transition than a deeper\ntransition commenced earlier.” We support the ‘firewall’ principle that New Zealand’s targets must be achieved by actual reductions in\n\nour own domestic emissions and not through the purchase of overseas carbon credits or an over-reliance on forests as carbon\nsinks. We support setting legally binding climate budgets that are set at a bare-minimum ambition, which must be achieved or\nbettered by government within the prescribed timeframes. While budgets should be binding, policy recommendations from the\n\nCommission should be just that – recommendations. The world needs pathways to transformational change if we are to avoid\ncatastrophic warming. This is the scale of the challenge. The science is clear: the only way we can succeed is with big ambition. New\n\nZealand must be bold and pass strong law for the sake of our precious earth and future generations. We support the establishment\nof a Climate Change Commission. The commission’s role should include: • devising binding climate budgets • identifying the level of\n\nreduction for each form of greenhouse gas (long-lived and short-lived) • monitoring adherence to the set ‘firewall’ • monitoring\nprogress towards our targets • monitoring cumulative emissions • advising on adaptation. The Climate Change Commission should\n\nprovide advice to the New Zealand government. To ensure transparency and accountability, I support the Government being required\nto table all reports from the Climate Change Commission to Parliament. We support the Government preparing a National Climate Risk\nAssessment. The Government must be required to produce an Adaption Programme to address the climate risks identified in the\n\nNational Climate Risk Assessment. As authors of a guidebook on carbon farming (\"The Carbon Forest, 2010\") we observe that a weak\nETS has resulted in insignificant carbon emission reductions and a great sense of uncertainty. This uncertainty has prevented\n\nbusinesses from investing in (a) carbon sequestration, and (b) carbon emission reductions. The Zero Carbon Bill (and all government\nbehaviors) need to be coherent with our Paris Climate Agreement commitments in order to provide certainty for business decision\n\nmakers.",

  "ENFORCEMENT: the UK model does not give the Committee an enforcement role because this was believed to politicise it. This\nshould be reconsidered in NZ's case. Climate Change is an urgent intergenerational issue and there needs to be the means to\n\nenforce duties and budgets under the new Act. My suggestions are as follows: - if judicial review is to remain a means to enforce,\nthen the Act must make clear and careful provision for this - giving the courts and litigants clear guidance and protecting against\n\nabuse; and - an enforcer needs to be identified. If not the Committee then who? It is NOT appropriate to leave this to civil society\nwithout additional support. I note that in the UK, there is real concern about the implications of BREXIT and the loss of the EU\n\nCommission's enforcement role and the need for a new independent enforcement agency.

LOCAL GOVERNMENT: local government will be critical in achievement of mitigation.\nGovernment needs to consider reversing the 2004 amendments to the RMA, assisting with the development of emission targets at\nregional/local levels, and working with local government to achieve NZ's target.

  "Animals raised by grass fed systems can be a net carbon sink. This is the finding of a new study by scientists from Michigan State\nUniversity that was published in the Agricultural Systems journal. After evaluating adaptive multi-paddock (AMP) grass-fed operations\n\nand grain-fed, feedlot ones, they concluded that AMP grazing has the potential to offset greenhouse gas emissions, while the end\nphase of beef production can actually be a net carbon sink. They reached their conclusion by reviewing past studies and carrying out\nnew research over the course of four years at their Lake Station AgBioResearch Center using herds of more than 200 steers. They\n\nlooked at statistics from the finishing phase, including daily weight gain and carcass weight, and compared it to the carbon dioxide,\nmethane and nitrous oxide from fermentation and digestion, feed production, farm energy use and manure storage. They also\nassessed the carbon losses that arose from soil erosion. I do not like industrialised farming but our beef and sheep farms are virtually\n\nall run on grass fed systems and many of our dairy farms. The worst offenders are Corporate dairy units owned by businessmen\nrather than farmers. The idealogy of Climate change is to change the economic structure of the world. United Nations (U.N.) official\n\nChristina Figueres recently made a stunning statement at a Brussels news conference, admitting that global warming is a hoax.\nFigueres, the executive secretary of the U.N.’s Framework Convention on Climate Change, carefully worded her admission. The\n\ntakeaway is that climate activists aren’t actually trying to save the planet, they’re trying to kill capitalism. Figueres initially stated: “This\nis the first time in the history of mankind that we are setting ourselves the task of intentionally, within a defined period of time, to\nchange the economic development model that has been reigning for at least 150 years, since the Industrial Revolution.” Figueres\n\nreiterates, “This is probably the most difficult task we have ever given ourselves, which is to intentionally transform the economic\ndevelopment model for the first time in human history.” Reported February 2017",

Comparing this to other countries is unhelpful as other countries don't have the reliance on commodity\nexports like New Zealand does. In the Appendix of the Consultation document under agriculture is states that land use change to\n\nlower emitting uses will likely be needed to achieve material emissions reductions from agriculture. I find this worrying and hope that\nno farmer will be forced to change their system. Sure, if there is voluntary land use change that is fine, however forcing reductions\nthrough capping cow numbers etc should not be an option. I know I have stated that I believe too high a reliance is placed on the\n\nplanting of trees however this is a key part of reaching our targets. In the appendix under forestry is states that \"forestry helps buy us\ntime until other technological developments or option become available\".

Normally thirty years of data is required to determine climate related trends.\nHowever, waiting thirty years to attribute events or damages to climate change versus normal climate variation is impractical and\n\nwould not satisfy public and political demands for information on issues such as climate change loss and damage. An alternative\napproach could be to allocate events and damages to be climate change related using a balance of evidence approach, then after\n\nsufficient time has elapsed and data accumulated, the allocated events and damages can be attributed (on a robust statistical basis)\nand compared with initial allocations. For example, if a heavy precipitation event is consistent with a pattern of climate change then it\n\nmight be allocated in part or full as being part of an anthropogenic climate change trend. Similarly the value of damages might also be\nallocated to being climate change related based on the weight of evidence. The key to this approach is to update figures once more\ntime series data becomes available and to assess how accurate allocations appear with time (i.e. it is essential to practice allocations\n\nand get feedback).",

I'm worried climate change will never be prioritised because it is so nebulous, and its effects are so hard to understand and pin\nupon a single phenomenon. Even today its effects are being felt, and people still deny climate change is the root as there is no\n\ndefinitive scientific way of doing this. This act needs priority within our government. Please consider entrenching something so\nimportant. The UK act that this bill is highly influenced by is so successful due to the bi-partisan support it has enjoyed over history.\nWe clearly don't have that yet. Therefore, entrenchment is the only protection this act may have over its lifetime. We must also\n\nconsider incentives in ensuring action happens. The less discussed aspect of the UK Act is that the country is now struggling to\nkeep up with the demands of its future targets. No one knows how they will be achieved and at present it is doubted they can be. No\n\ntarget has yet been failed to be met, but this may change soon. So how will we make sure the same won't happen here? I doubt a\nvoluntary basis will be enough to create the change needed for the ambition currently proposed by the government.",

The\nemissions from transport, industrial activity, agriculture, and all other sources should be included in the target. Even ‘short-lived’\n\ngasses can have a huge effect on our climate and need to be reduced. Emissions budgets should be at least as important as fiscal\nbudgets, and the Government should set plans to achieve them. An independent Climate Change Commission of experts should\n\nmonitor emissions and give advice to keep New Zealand on-track for its emissions reduction goals.",

  "On a slightly related matter, in early July 2018, I submitted a proposal to the Hutt City Council for an improved method of rubbish\n\ndisposal. This could hugely reduce the amount of waste plastic and paper in the environment, while easing the load on landfills,\nimproving the quality of material sent to recycling and providing useful \"boiler fuel\". This would involve no major changes to the\n\nexisting arrangements, but would add a new option. The new option (\"Project Orange\") would nominally involve using pre-paid,\norange-coloured plastic bags for combustible, non-halogenated solid waste materials. Households and businesses would voluntarily\n\nput all odds and sods of waste plastic (non-halogenated), paper, cardboard, small wood scraps etc into this bag, which would be\ncollected by the council in the normal collection. But instead of going to landfill or recycling, it would be used for thermal power\ngeneration, industrial steam generation, heating of large buildings or simply burned off to dispose of it. By being burned usefully, this\n\ncould hugely decrease the escape of plastics into the sea, heavily reduce the load on landfills, and allow a small reduction in\nconsumption of coal, natural gas and/or biomass. (The last part would be good for decreasing carbon dioxide emissions by\n\ndecreasing the mining and use of fossil fuels).",
  "A huge part of resilience and developing a low carbon economy is focusing on local community economic development. Local jobs,\n\nlocal food production, local businesses, empowered local government. We need to reduce the hours worked per week so that\npeople have time to garden, make, fix, share. We need local community and neighbourhood gardens and orchards. An interlinked\n\ncommunity is also a strong community and this is a key resilience aspect. There is no point building resilient infrastructure but not\nbuilding the interlinked community that uses those resources.\n",

At present our regulatory environment condemns everything vaguely nuclear and fails to distinguish between environmentally\n\nsafe and unsafe. Potentially Thorium plants could: Be scaleable down to units the size of shipping containers thus eliminating\nkilometers of high voltage transmission lines and our whole national grid The energy could benefit the whole economy and replace\ngas generation It can make safe nuclear waste It can produce rare earths as a by product and break China's monopoly on these\n\nproducts that are so vital for high tech solutions It could provide abundant power for our future green transport and all the other uses\nwe have for it.

Two questions must be asked\nand answered: 1. If the climate changes rapidly in the other direction, i.e. it begins cooling as it has over the past few years, what will\nbe the response of the government? Maybe to burn oil to produce more CO2? 2. If climate keeps on changing, will that mean that we\n\nwill require a less than zero carbon Bill? What will be the government's response when they find, as they will, that regardless of what\nthey do, the climate continues to do its own thing? No, you won't have thought of these and certainly won't want to think of them in\n\nyour idealised, we're in control of everything world.

For this reason\n methane should always have considered as a separate issue and not just lumped in with all of the long term gases. A huge disservice\n\n has been done to New Zealand and agriculture in particular by this monumental blunder .For example the \" 40% of our emissions\n from agriculture\" that we hear so often is scientifically a nonsense yet we are at risk of making ridiculous policy decisions on the\n strength of it.As well as that, New Zealand's emissions are actually much less per person than we have declared .

  "The name of this Carbon Zero Bill demonstrates that the proponents of the bill have no knowledge or understanding of elementary\nscience. Carbon is a base element, a major part of all plants, grass, trees, animals, mankind and a major part of our soils. If the Bill is\n\nreferring to Carbon Dioxide, then again, the proponents of the bill have no knowledge or understanding of elementary science.\nCarbon dioxide is an inert, odourless, tasteless very minor trace gas in the atmosphere. CO2 is a tiny portion of the atmosphere at\n\n0.04% or 405 ppm of the atmosphere, manmade CO2 is just 3% of total CO2 or 12 ppm. Historic climate cycles are ignored with the\nclaims that human related activities are emitting greenhouse gases that is increasing the average global temperature at an\n\naccelerated rate compared to historical temperatures. There is no the data to back this claim, only the IPCC computer models – all\nhave been wrong. The Royal Society of NZ, Professor James Renwick, Dairy NZ and Minister James Shaw cannot provide any data that\nproves the claims of accelerated global temperature increase are caused by mankind. The claim that reducing manmade CO2\n\nemissions that are 3% of total CO2 in the atmosphere will stabilise the climate are just fraud. The climate much more complex than\njust CO2 and methane. Yes, we have Climate Change but the climate has always changed over the past centuries and always will\n\ncontinue to change, nothing new in this. Considerable parts of NZ are flood plains, protected by stop banks. Yes we have recent\nglobal warming, from the Medieval Warm Period, 900-1200 the earth cooled 2° C to the Little Ice Age, 1600-1800, it has warmed\n\n0.81° C since 1850 as we recover from the Little Ice age, nothing exceptional about this. This is Natural variability. Or would you prefer\nthe climatic conditions of the little ice age? In the AR5 IPCC report their scientists admitted that the world is warming more slowly than\n\npredicted, the IPCC predicted a warming of 0.34° C per decade but it is only 0.11° C. Ignored. The Carbon Cycle is the fundamental\npathway ahead but it is completely ignored. Repeatedly it is demonstrated that there is no understanding of the carbon cycle and\ncarbon dioxide’s vital role in all life on earth. Water vapour the dominant greenhouse gas is 10,000 ppm of the atmosphere, CO2 is\n\n405 ppm of the atmosphere, manmade CO2 is 3% or 12 ppm, Methane is 1.8 ppm of the atmosphere, livestock emissions are only\n17% of methane emissions which equals 0.306 ppm A steady state of methane is off-set by CO2 sequestration growing grass and\n\ncrops. Basic physics – you can only emit what is sequestered. Agricultural emissions must be accounted for on a net emission basis.\nNZ has 3% of the worlds dairy cows, what happens to the worlds other 97% ? No other country in the world is stupid enough to tax\n\nagriculture, their food producers. NZ emissions are very small, only 0.17% of global emissions There are 1600 coal fired power\nstations being constructed or planned China, presently 13.5%, says it will double by 2030, India, presently 6.8% says it will triple by\n2030 Electricity. There will be big increase in demand for electricity by a growing population, EVs and other industrial electrification.\n\nMore hydro? More wind and solar are very expensive because they are very intermittent and need an equal amount of back up\ngeneration or face blackouts. There are no proposals or cost/ benefit analysts. It is absolutely essential that our present fossil fuel\n\nbackup generation be retained for security of supply. Lessons must be learnt from Australia, UK and Germany the problems they are\nhaving attempting to move to wind generation as well as the 25% increase in power prices their consumers are facing. NZ must\n\nfacture in the huge transitional import costs of a new transport fleet, huge costs for additional power generation at the same time our\nmain export base is restrained. In 2017 NZ Current account deficit was - $7.7 billion, that is, NZ imports $7.7 billion more in goods and\n\nservices than it exports. How are we going to pay for all the additional imports required? Reducing NZ’s emissions of 0.17% will\nreduce global temperatures by how much? = 0 N Z is very small export dependent country, our industries and exporters cannot\nsurvive the extra costs that will be imposed by this bill that their overseas competitors do not have.

  "75% Vote by Parliament to set and change targets and policies In order to ensure stability of political purpose and cross-party\nrepresentation, the Carbon Bill should include the requirement that climate change targets and policies are set and changed only\n\nwhen there is a 75% of all Members of Parliament endorsement vote. Immediate reductions in methane gas emissions All countries,\nincluding New Zealand, need to reduce GHG emissions as soon as possible in order to reduce the risk of runaway methane\n\nemissions from thawing tundra. Most methods of reducing GHG emissions take time, including planting saplings to absorb carbon\ndioxide. In the meantime, seasonal adjusted levels of GHG in the atmosphere increase monotonically. Methane emissions by\n\nruminants in New Zealand contribute a major source of the nation’s carbon dioxide equivalents. A 10% reduction in methane\nemissions could be implemented within weeks by Government decree to reduce herd numbers. Farmers around the world have\nbeen paid not to grow crops. New Zealand can and should likewise pay its farmers to reduce their herds of ruminants and assist\n\ntransition to alternative food production. In the 1970s the New Zealand economy adapted to a three-fold followed by a two-fold\nincrease of petrol prices at the pump. This scale of adaptation far surpasses that of an immediate 10% reduction in herd numbers.\n\nNew Zealand has the economic resilience to absorb the costs of paying farmers to immediately reduce their herds by 10% which\nwould be followed by subsequent reductions in herd numbers as farmers transition to alternative food production. I recommend that\n\nGovernment immediately decrees a 10% reduction in ruminant herd numbers in New Zealand. 100% renewable electricity. New\nZealand needs to phase out use of fossil fuel-based generation of electricity by 2050 and according to a confidence & supply\nagreement between the Labour Party and the Green Party, the nation’s Climate Commission will be requested to plan the transition to\n\n100% renewable electricity by as early as 2035. However, in its 2018 Draft Report, the Productivity Commission’s recommendations\nR12.1 to R12.4 for the Electricity Authority on page 433 do not include the need and urgency for Government to invest in renewable\n\nenergy projects in its programme of works. The Draft Report states on page 321 that \"if reducing emissions from electricity\ngeneration significantly increases the costs of electricity, this could delay the electrification of other sectors where the reductions are\n\npotentially larger.\" An Emissions Pricing Scheme can provide Government with revenue and this revenue can be used by Government\nto invest in renewable energy projects to maintain stable electricity prices. A 2017 survey by Carl and Fedor which tracks current\n\nglobal carbon revenues has established that Cap-and-trade systems (ETS) earmark 70% of revenues for “green” spending. The New\nZealand Government can and should follow suit by either investing directly in renewable energy projects or by subsidising smaller\nscale renewable energy projects initiated by City Councils, community groups, or individuals. I recommend that Government invests in\n\nrenewable energy projects using revenue generated by an adopted Emissions Pricing Scheme in order to attain 100% renewable\nelectricity by 2050. Electrification of the New Zealand city-to-city railway network. The Productivity Commission’s 2018 Draft Report\n\naddresses electrification of the North Island Main Trunk line and the advantages of doing so on page 310, but does not include a\nrecommendation to electrify New Zealand’s city-to-city railway network. The Draft Report assumes and endorses that market place\n\nforces alone will result a major transition from fossil-fuelled vehicles to EVs by 2050. A major uptake of EVs is technically feasible, but\nis not necessarily viable given the high private costs of purchasing EVs and replacement of their batteries, whereas an essential\nelectrification of New Zealand’s railway network is both technically feasible and viable provided Government undertakes the\n\ncommitment to do so. I recommend that Government electrify the city-to-city New Zealand railway network. Examination of the\ncontinuation to provide power to the Tiwai Point aluminium smelter The Productivity Commission’s 2018 Draft Report states on page\n\n294 that “Electric vehicles are one of New Zealand’s most promising mitigation opportunities.” A 100% fleet of electric vehicles in\nNew Zealand by 2050 would require substantial additional electricity generation. The Draft Report addresses ways of reducing\n\ndemand for electricity in a number of sectors in the economy and mentions on page 333 that the aluminium smelter plant at Tiwai\nPoint could be “incentivised” to help smooth demand peaks and reduce the need for on-call thermal generation. The Tiwai Point\n\naluminium smelter plant currently uses 570 MW of electricity which is about 15% of current peak hydro electricity output. This level of\ncontinuous consumption of electricity begs the question of whether the Tiwai Point aluminium smelter plant’s continued use of\nelectricity should take priority over New Zealand’s need for additional electricity during the transition phase from fossil fuels to\n\nrenewable energy. A comprehensive study of peak demand and risk should include not only “incentivisation” to help smooth demand\npeaks but also address the issue of whether the Tiwai Point smelter plant should continue to use such a large percentage of New\n\nZealand’s hydroelectricity output. I recommend that Government carries out a study of the impact of the Tiwai Point aluminium\nsmelter plant continuing its current consumption of electricity when additional electricity will be needed by electric vehicles and\n\nelectrification of a city-to-city New Zealand railway network. GDP is an inadequate indicator of wellbeing The two different economic\nmodels developed by Vivid Economics (Vivid) and the New Zealand Institute of Economic Research (NZIER) to gain insights into the\neconomy-wide impacts of reaching different emissions reductions targets are both seriously flawed. This is because their projections\n\nof progress are based on projections of GDP which is not an indicator of wellbeing. GDP conflates all forms of economic activity\nregardless of positive or negative impacts on wellbeing. An example is the economic activity of rebuilding required after earthquakes\n\nhit Christchurch. Few people would claim that citizens in Christchurch were better off after the destructive earthquake and during the\nrebuild. GDP makes no adjustment for leisure time. The number of work hours can increase rather than decrease in order to retain a\n\nstandard of living. GDP counts only those goods and services that are recorded through official markets and leaves out home\nproduction and black-market activity. GDP makes no adjustments for the distribution of goods and services. For example, a minority of\n\nthe population can enjoy higher standards of living as GDP per capita increases while the majority struggle more and more to make\nends meet. GDP does not measure externalities of economic activity. An example is the deterioration of our waterways in recent years\ndue to pollution generated by the agricultural sector. Nobel prize-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz noted at a World Economic Forum\n\nin Davos, Switzerland in 2016 that \"GDP is a poor way of assessing the health of our economies and we urgently need to find a new\nmeasure.\" There are alternative indicators of welfare. For example, the Index of Sustainable Economic Welfare accounts for both\n\npollution costs and the distribution of income and the Genuine Progress Indicator adjusts for factors such as income distribution,\nadds factors such as the value of household and volunteer work, and subtracts factors such as the costs of crime and pollution. I\n\nrecommend that Government replaces GDP as a measure of wellbeing with OECD endorsed indicators of wellbeing. Assumption that\nNew Zealand should strive for economic growth. The Ministry for the Environment (MFE) FINAL- Zero Carbon Bill - Discussion\nDocument and the Productivity Commission’s 2018 Draft Report both assume that New Zealand is able to and should strive for\n\ncontinued economic growth during the transition from fossil fuels to renewables. A 2% increase in economic activity each year would\nresult in a doubling of economic activity in 35 years’ time. It is highly questionable whether this target should be attempted given the\n\nneed to reduce greenhouse gases rather than increase them. Some proponents claim that GDP and energy can be decoupled, but\nthere are physical and thermodynamic limits to the extent that decoupling can take place. A transition from fossil fuels to renewable\n\nenergy will, of course, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, but a major problem is that such a transition will require use of fossil fuels\nto set up new infrastructure, plant, machinery, vehicles etc. (embodied energy) at the very same time as the need to reduce\n\ngreenhouse gas emissions. In order to satisfy both requirements, use of fossil fuels will therefore need to be diverted from that of\nconsumption to that of investment. Expectations that business as usual can and will continue during a transition from fossil fuels to\nrenewable energy and that economic growth can and should continue at a time when we need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions\n\nare unrealistic. Hybrid Emissions Pricing Scheme The Productivity Commission’s 2018 Draft Report makes the following\nRecommendation R4.1 on page 416: “The Government should reform the NZ Emissions Trading Scheme rather than replace it with a\n\ncarbon tax. The reforms should provide a good balance between control over unit supply (i.e., an effective emissions cap) and\nprotection against excessive volatility in the price of emission units. The reforms should also provide the institutional and regulatory\n\nunderpinnings for a credible and efficient market in emission units, as well as transparency and forward guidance to incentivise long-\nterm investments in lower emissions.” There are clear cut and distinctive advantages and disadvantages of a pure Carbon Tax versus\na pure Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) which are addressed in the preamble and findings that precede R4.1. Given the combination\n\nof the preamble and findings followed by the wording of R4.1, the intent of R4.1 seems to seek the advantages of both a Carbon Tax\nand an ETS. Such a scheme would be a hybrid scheme as described in the public literature and recommended by a number of\n\nsources. The devil of implementation of a hybrid scheme lies within the details. For example, a hybrid scheme can be an ETS which\nnot only caps a limit on emissions, but also sets a minimum price cap which effectively results in a minimum carbon tax. I recommend\n\nthat New Zealand adopts a Hybrid Emissions Pricing Scheme with a cap on emissions and a minimum cap on carbon pricing with full\nGovernment control over the auction process.",
  "If farming is going to be engaged in this it must be done in good faith that all grass land, trees, scrub and any other forms of carbon\nfixing should be calculated. Other areas of reducing costs for farmers should also be considered eg Rates (local and regional), Health\n\nand safety, animal welfare costs, inheritance costs. I fear that in this process that the NZ farmers exports will nolonger be able to\ncompete in the rest of the worlds markets",

  "The Paris Agreement is a hugely expensive joke and is more about the promotion of diversity and equaility through the redistibution\nof first world wealth than climate change. We should not take it seriously to the detriment of our society when the biggest pollutors\n\ncontinue openly on a path to ramp up emissions. Our emissions total is insignificant in the scope of things, especially when viewed in\nlight of developing worlds attitude towards emmission reduction. Our goals should reflect our significance and admit that Zero nett\ncarbon is nice but unobtainable dream, so lets be realistic and aim for 60% reduction. We can easily meet this target by some\n\nmoderate changes to agriculture to drive soil carbon capture but these would require a subsidisation model. Ie paying farmers to let\nland lie in fallow and develop crops for soil carbon capture. Not likely we will embrace artificial economics like subsidization though.\n\nNatural gas was one of the most effective forms of energy to assist on this pathway, zero logic in Governments decision sorry. Are we\nprepared to get real about the cost of bunker fuel for shipping that drives the consumer based segment of our economy, or the real\n\ncost of air travel that has massive increases in tourists projected? Doubt it. It is very easy to sort out our electricty and transition the\nsmall percentage from coal generation to hydro or geo thermal capacity. Will environmntal groups support damming of rivers if it\n\nmeans replacing Huntly? Is it possible to get planning consent to build a Hydro dam in the time we have left? One positive is that\npolitical ideologies may be forced to accept common ground on some issues. If we are serious about a net zero carbon future we\nneed to disperse with many of the out-moded ideologies that pervade environmentalism. For example, the cyclone Ita legislation to\n\nsalvage timber on conservation land resulted in $40 million GDP generation, including $1.7 million direct conservation funding.\nApproximately 6% of the allowable volume of timber was removed and an estimate 1/10th of 1% of the total downed biomass was\n\nremoved. This is a perfect example of local community response to a massive natural event and is important in the context that New\nZealand now imports $94 million of timber and $480 million of solid wooden furniture. Our indigenous industry produces around 4%\n\nof what our society consumes. All these imports are produced under inferior legislation and shipped to NZ using bunker fuel that\ndoes not reflect the true cost of emissions. By allowing a region like the West Coast to apply world leading resource management\npractices to some of its plentiful natural resources we can create regional and national wealth and offset the damage of consumer\n\ndemand does globally. Try getting the limited, regulated use of windthrown timber past Eugene Sage James. Finally we are in a\nposition where ridiculous green ideology is diametrically opposed to itself. Time for a cup of tea before the world ends.",
  "While the discussion paper recognizes the many elements in a moves towards lower emissions from transport ( such as urban\ndesign and public transport), there should be a strong recognition that our transport system is far too dependent on private vehicles.\n\nA technical fix like EVs should be treated with caution ( especially in the light of the embodied energy in EVs). If not, the promise of\nsuch solutions will suggest that we can carry on as usual, just with better gadgetry.",
  "The NZ economy is small, and fragile. NZ has no overtime laws as they were seen as detrimental to the economy (which in fact, they\naren't, but that's a different story). Obviously, the economy is of critical importance to all NZ-ers. Raising taxes will not help anyone,\n\nexcept the government. But rule no.1 of economies is that they perform better with smaller governments! So, lower taxes mean\nmore money for the people. More money for the people means more taxes, which helps the government. But it doesn't work the\n\nother way around. In addition, NZ already has a \"brain-drain\", whereby all the brightest minds and hardest workers leave the country\nfor Australia or beyond, as they can far outearn their NZ career opportunities by doing so. This has led to a shortage of skilled\nprofessionals in various areas, something that the government has been well aware of for many years (enough to put in place\n\nprocedures for attracting such professionals). By taxing people yet more, for an unproven science is tantamount to economic\nsuicide. I urge the government to scrap these plans immediately, and put all the money that would be spent on it, into ways of\n\nimproving the economy, first and foremost.",

  "I think the proposals and process leading to the Bill are excellent, and probably as strong as they can be made in the current political\n\nclimate—a climate that, like the physical one, will change. What I propose goes beyond that, and the simple logic will appeal to you\neach individually, though you may not feel able to discuss it. The point is to effect a solution, not merely postpone it, and in deeper\n\ndiscussion to look beyond 2050, when no amount of transformation, of industry or consumption, will be adequate without simple\nreduction. It is hard to speak of de-industrialisation, de-consumption, and deceleration, and at the far end of those, depopulation; yet\n\nthat very discussion is occurring outside official circles. If it has not reached good currency soon, then continuing growth in demand\nwill destroy any targets. What you can do, having absorbed this imperative, is look carefully at wording, to assist this embryonic\ncultural change into the world. Useful qualifying phrases, such as “while the population is so excessive,” “while industry remains so\n\ninefficient, unnecessary, and destructive,” and “while striving for jobs tends to create needless infrastructure, destruction, and\ntransaction costs,” will gently begin to point the way to more lasting solutions. These refer unflinchingly to the global economic\n\ncontext. You may, some of you, think there is no alternative, but that does not make them invalid.",

It does not however take into\n\nconsideration the embodied emissions of a cars production, and how their accessibility (of having extremely low running costs) will\nimpact the way we use vehicles.

  "Information relevant to this topic that I have seen to date is as wide and as deep as you can get, like the Pacific Ocean, but all of it\n lacks a locus or a single point of leverage. The message that looms in my mind is that, “New Zealand Must Have a Smart Energy\n\n Management System”….Now! It is where a realistic and achievable Zero Carbon Plan must start. Making use of it will create a\n projection along a timeline that ends in zero thirty years from now (16 July 2018) by adherence under the appropriate legislation. All\n Kiwi’s must live under the symbolic energy-tight roof that the project line and “Carbon Zero Act” creates. See sample of project line\n\n below. The Smart Energy Management system must be developed by those who fully understand the scientific, engineering and\n technological requirements, and they will be responsible for ensuring the information gathered is useable, accurate and honest, and\n\n is free from vested interest and deviant behaviour. Perhaps we can call this body of ‘thinkers’ a “Science, Engineering and\n Technology Commission”. The quality of the information is paramount. Others can use the data for the decision making process via\n the political arena which must focus on fairness and positive social outcomes. But the supporting data provided once authenticated\n\n and signed off, must not be changed or tinkered with. The key social tool is to develop a ‘live’ and accurate NZ Sanky Diagram that\n truly represents the fully dynamic national energy transformation flow. It must be permanently available on the web, so that its main\n benefit will be that of education; but there will be countless other benefits too, which will keep everyone busy and perhaps\n\n productive . If ordinary people can see progress is being made they often become enthused and interested, and then get in behind.\n See example of ‘Sanky Diagram’ below. Dollars and cents should not be included because it skews reality. ‘Joules (the unit of energy,\n\n and the cubit of our modern world)’ is the real measure (standard) that everyone needs to become acquainted with. Dollars have\n their use, and are just another important tool that can be used to facilitate progress by unsticking wheels and ensure forward motion,\n but it must be used in the most appropriate way and subordinate to the metric of the Joule. The above is the key message. Much of\n\n the material I have seen to date is of high quality, plausible and thoroughly researched by good and dedicated people, but only those\n with PhD’s and the like will understand what it is all about, but the other 95 to 80% won’t have a clue and therefore they will rubbish it\n and not provide the support that is needed. Even the best, cleverest and most sincere politicians will fail. For the multitude “Keep it\n\n Simple” as they are the ones that must be persuaded and then convinced in a positive way. Communication is the key and a national\n ‘Sanky Diagram’ illustrating the energy transformation process would be the most powerful one for getting the most important\n\n message of our time across to almost everyone. Other charts, symbols and graphics can be used as aids. Cameos, serials and charts\n and information pathways for drilling wide and deep for detail and expert data, but it must start with simplicity. See examples below\n (but use Jules {after all she’s much prettier and socially acceptable, and work alongside “Max”…”Jules and Max the Dynamic Duo” …\n\n even a little humour can be used to keep the learning process positive and stimulating}; BUT not tweets, although in the\n background they might help to measure public reaction and support. The above proposal is a better way of doing things than in the\n\n past. We don’t necessarily have to get positive results by doing it all by the use of just an alphabet, as is the case in the West. We can\n also use symbols and icons like the Chinese and Asians do, and innovate too. We need to… no, must give it a go, now! Results are\n what counts.

To protect the public confidence, it is necessary to use transparent processes\n\nand create an entirely independent public watchdog, that has a legislated obligation to investigate and ‘whistle-blow’, when attempts\nare made to subvert the commission’s work. That independence of thought and action is guaranteed. Governments change and so,\ntherefore, do priorities, policy and ways of working. Any commissioners or other body need to be independent of political and normal\n\nadministrative structures to remain apolitical. That there is a requirement to seek causes rather than symptoms. An illustrative\nexample: transport is a major carbon emitter. Shifting the vehicle fleet to electric vehicles merely treats a symptom, where being\nprepared to remedy cause by redeveloping our cities to low-carbon, sustainable, more productive, more liveable forms. Working on\n\ncauses is much harder, but necessary. That our legislators and administrators not be proud. That it be mandated that advice be\nactively sought from outside New Zealand on technologies and methods. We need to be able to learn from other people’s successes\n\nand mistakes. That the wisdom of contrarian views are considered. Some caution is needed with some of the technologies becoming\navailable and a very critical assessment is vital. Being first with something like a heavy uptake in battery technology that might swiftly\nbe made obsolete by hydrogen-based energy storage would be very unwise. That courage be a requirement. The moral courage to\n\nenact necessary measures that may be unpopular is going to be needed, as well as the practical ability to withstand the assaults of\nspecial interest groups and changing government’s priorities. Both of those need to be somehow built in to legislation. That the\n\nneed for great change is accepted. The changes required have the potential to put New Zealand on what is effectively an emergency\nfooting and may, at times, require extraordinary measures. That plain speaking – in all languages - be required.",

Nature is our taonga and we cannot exist without it. We must act together. The key\n\nthings I support in a Zero Carbon Act are: A target for net-zero carbon emissions by 2040 should be in the Act. The emissions from\ntransport, industrial activity, agriculture, and all other sources should be included in the target. Even ‘short-lived’ gasses can have a\n\nhuge effect on our climate and need to be reduced. Emissions budgets should be at least as important as fiscal budgets, and the\nGovernment should set plans to achieve them. An independent Climate Change Commission of experts should monitor emissions\n\nand give advice to keep New Zealand on-track for its emissions reduction goals.",
  "Fighting climate change is going to cost truckloads of money. Every decision needs to be vetted by the Climate Change Commission.\nFor example, Dunedin is going to get a new hospital on the site of the old Cadbury's Chocolate Factory. This is a mistake as far as the\n\nsite is concerned and a waste of money. That site lacks elevation and will be one of the early victims of rising sea levels. The site for\nthe new hospital needs to be changed to higher ground. We need both the carrot and stick approach to take on the problem.\nPenalise those old school behaviours and reward the better ones. We need to shut down the Huntly power stations and get to 100\n\npercent renewable soon. We don't have any large scale solar generation in New Zealand though. EVs need more of an incentive. New\ncars are expensive and if we want to have mass uptake, there needs to be money thrown at them. Many countries have subsidies for\n\nnew EV purchase and all we do is waive the RUC and have some transit lane access in Auckland. Introduce a financial subsidy for new\nEV purchases. I have attached an example (picture) where only cars costing less than $100,000 can get a subsidy, which is capped\nat $5,000 per purchase. This would allow a greater uptake of EVs - I mean if somebody can afford to pay $100,000 for an EV, would a\n\n$1,000 subsidy be a deal breaker? Rather different if your car is costing you $30,000 and you can get a $5,000 subsidy! That could\nbe the difference between buy an EV vs. a petrol car. Have a look at Norway. The government threw lots of money towards EV\n\nownership - it was so good, they achieved their target 3 years ahead of schedule. It cost them a lot though, but EVs and hybrids sales\naccount for nearly 50% of all new vehicles in Norway.",

  "SUBMISSION ON THE ZERO-CARBON BILL. I welcome this opportunity to make a submission as I am confident that the probability of\n\n human induced global warming and its consequences are so great that a precautionary approach must be taken with vigor. If human\n rights are to be considered then rationing must be the end goal to avoid a situation where the rich can avoid the consequences that\n\n we all must face. The greatest polluters must take the biggest change. The creation of a Bill is supported. In approaching the\n submission form I could not help resisting the tick box approach. I do not have a feel for the degree of effect of goals, stabilisation, or\n targets. The most important action is to actually reduce the effect of the heat inducing gasses by reductions rather than legislating a\n\n magic figure. The target/goal must be secondary. Actual reduction of the most polluting gases must be the most energetically\n reduced. The reductions must take place now. I felt constrained by predetermined structure of the submission form. I worked\n\n through a review of the form with friends trying to respond to the proscribed feedback. I am diverting from the form. The problem\n rises from the excessive growth in population. I know that orthodox economists promote the fantasy of growth being a goal as a\n matter of ideology. This basic fact must be recognised. The economists target of GDP has no good meaning for the welfare of\n\n people. Growth means that the infrastructure that is needed always lags behind and much endless effort is required to catch up. A\n human and satisfactory life can be had in a no-growth stabilised equilibrium status. In such a society at equilibrium and with a\n\n balanced infrastructure, there will be no need to always falling behind. People will find that dying people will leave houses at the rate\n that will supply people wanting to set up a family home. New houses will not be needed. There will be no need to build new roads,\n water supply dams, filtration plants, stadiums, power plants, transmission lines, factories, hospitals, conference centres, warehouses,\n\n office blocks, hangars, airports, ports, or clear new land for cultivation. The requirements of a steady state population will be met by a\n constant infrastructure balanced to the needs of steady population. What will remain important is to keep up with maintenance of the\n\n infrastructure which often gets forgotten in the need to cope with the growth. We could all then have a good work-life balance\n without having to work too hard in always having to catch up. The only losers in this stable situation will be banks which depend on\n the never ending need to advance more capital and create more debt in the need to catch up with infrastructure. It is the constant\n\n trying to catch up with infrastructure that requires the activities that produce most of the excessive harmful gases. I assure you that I\n and my two daughters are breeding in replacement mode only. My ancestors had too many children for stability. This should be a goal\n\n for all parents. Reducing the polluting gas creation must mean that there will be a lot of stranded assets. Tough. The risks businesses\n once took on have not paid off because they did not take into account the damaging externalities they produced. There will need to\n significant changes in current activities. Production of cement produces CO2 effluent. This means a move away from using concrete.\n\n The production of aluminium produces CO2 in about the same weight as the Al. Al production also produces small amounts of very\n polluting gases. As the ‘pots’ used in the electrolysis operation become inefficient and are retired, they should not be replaced and a\n gradual decline in production will occur, scaling down the production of polluting gases. The gain in electricity supply will offset any\n\n the need to produce CO2 in marginal power by coal or gas fuel means. The requirement in the increase in electric transport needs\n can thus be met. The scaling back of the aluminium smelting is a win-win solution. The development of laminated wood that can be\n\n used for large buildings needs accelerating by government application to help with the transition from concrete, steel, and aluminium\n which contribute to the pollution in an accelerated substitution. The plan for increased tree planting is supported. But the colossal\n damage in Tolaga Bay by logs and slash coming down in floods and the amounts of it, requires a change in the way that forestry is\n\n done. The slash and waste left on the ground will decay and produce CO2. If the carbon taken up by the trees is to return to the\n atmosphere as CO2 we should get some benefit. That material should be used as the source material for a charcoal industry. This\n\n can be done be enforcing the removal of the waste to avoid flooding damage and be the input to a pyrolysis plant. Pyrolysis to\n produce charcoal is a very old industry and needs reviving. The output is a combination of materials that can be distilled into a wide\n range of chemicals (substituting for petroleum based production) and charcoal. The amount of waste seen at Tolaga Bay indicate that\n\n good sized efficient plants are feasible close to forestry operations. Charcoal can be used for pollution free home fires, substituting\n for coal as a heating agent in milk dehydration plants and other heating applications, as a high quality smelting material substituting\n\n for taking coal out of the ground, and as a soil improver that reduces the loss of nutrients. I think this means a return to the days\n when the state got involved in industry for the public benefit rather that relying on business to do it for the benefit of the wealthy few.\n In the past the state built the railways, P & T, NZED dams, etc for the public good. In the past we collectively had to get involved in\n\n insurance (State Ins), banking (BNZ), airlines, MOW etc when business was failing our needs. We need a direction for the common\n benefit not for niches that just might be profitable for the rich. Action is more important than making plans. The Climate Change\n\n Commission will have a very important role and could do with an Applied Mathematician. The loss of the Applied Maths Division of the\n old DSIR was a mistake as was the privatisation of the MOW. The State needs a lot of skills that have not been privatised to feed a\n private profit target rather than public benefit. The State will have to develop its own in-house expertise. I do not dispute the need for\n\n a set-point figure to work to. With my training as a chemical engineer I see the need for a Process Control System with a set point\n objective. The pollution set-point should be effectively a continuously reducing one, certainly not a 5 yr target steadily dropping to our\n\n commitments. The science of process control has advanced since I did a course in 1960 on my OE. Drone technology proves that. In\n process control the discrepancy from the set-point is measured for difference, rate of change and the integral of the difference.\n These three measurements are used to calculate correction activity in order to get change quickly and not overshoot nor create\n\n oscillations. This is highly technical and requires good calculus and understanding of Laplace Transforms, Nyquist criteria etc. Each\npolluting industry and business will have to have its own set-point for reducing its polluting gases. It interesting to note that before he\n\nwas effectively killed by the CIA, Salvador Allende was installing a type of industry control system called the Cybersyn system using\ncomputers and the telex network to manage using the skills of the British expert Stafford Beer. We could have learnt from that system\n\nif it had not been destroyed. Paul Bieleski, Nelson.",

  "This submission is to note my total opposition to the Zero Carbon Bill and the concepts it contains. I submit that: 1. The Zero Carbon\n\nBill is a total nonsense driven by a radical uninformed agenda that has the potential to bring our Nation to its’ knees. 2. Economic\nforecasts point out that the economy will be radically worse off and up to a quarter smaller. 3. The forecasts show that the burden will\n\nfall disproportionately on lower income households which is not tenable. 4. Modelling shows that NZ’s major earning sectors such as\nsheep, beef, and dairy farming economic output could be halved. This makes no sense. 5. The Zero Carbon Bill fails dismally by not\n\nrecognising the true impact of moving to ‘green technologies such as wind and solar power. Once a 'Whole of Life Cycle Analysis' is\ncarried out the impact of manufacturing these items demonstrates a gross negative cost in terms of cost and emissions. The use of\n\nsteel and other resources makes a nonsense of the ‘green technology claim.sss 6. The facts do not support the concept of taxing\nMethane. It is known that Methane is short-lived in the atmosphere. Without methane, New Zealand would have one of the smallest\ngreenhouse gas emissions profiles in the developed world. It hangs around for about 10 years before it is converted to CO2. 7.\n\nLivestock are carbon neutral and thus methane from agriculture should not be included in emissions targets. For every unit of carbon\nthe animal emits as CH4 it must ingest the same amount of carbon from its plant-based feed source, which, comes initially from the\n\nCO2 in the atmosphere. The animal is both the source of the carbon in methane and it is also the sink for the equivalent amount of\ncarbon in CO2. In this sense the carbon-methane cycle - methane-to-CO2-to-forage-plants-to-animals-to-methane - is a closed cycle.\n\nThe animal is CH4-carbon neutral. 8. The Bill makes no mention of the increased Methane emissions from the massive Government\nTree Planting Policy. Trees emit Methane thus if methane is included the Government Policy and the Bill are in direct contradiction. In\nsummary in my opinion the Zero Carbon Bill as proposed is a huge hoax, and will only drive the economy into a downward spiral.",

  "Dear Minister, I support the passing of legally binding climate law and maintain that Climate Change is a global problem – it cannot be\ntackled by countries in isolation. The law must be fair, ambitious and consistent with the climate science and international frameworks\n\nby including all gases and all sectors. The legislation should establish the goal of limiting warming to 1.5 degrees. We should not\nsettle for 2 degrees warming, that would lock in devastating impacts on Pacific Island states and cause significant extinctions. That is\n\nnot acceptable. To give us the best possibility of achieving no more than 1.5 degrees warming by the end of the century, there must\nbe rapid cuts in all greenhouse gases beginning now. I support a net-zero target of 2040 with the majority of cuts occurring over the\n\nnext decade. I support all greenhouse gases being included in the law, consistent with international climate frameworks. The\nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change makes it clear that methane reduction is critical to success in tackling climate change. It\nis politically and scientifically untenable for New Zealand’s climate law to exclude any gases from our biggest emitting sector - the\n\nagricultural sector. I support the establishment of a Climate Commission, whose role should be to devise binding budgets. The\nClimate Commission should have statutory teeth, otherwise, it is merely an advisory group that governments could ignore. Climate\n\nbudgets should be legally binding and set a bare-minimum ambition, which must be achieved or bettered by government within the\nprescribed timeframes. Finally, while budgets should be binding, policy recommendations from the Commission should be just that -\n\nrecommendations. I strongly support the ‘firewall’ principle – that New Zealand’s targets must be achieved by actual cuts in our own\nemissions, and not through the purchase of overseas carbon credits or an over-reliance on forests as carbon sinks. Regarding our\ninternational commitments, the Bill must include a requirement that governments produce annual reports about New Zealand’s\n\ninternational climate change contributions. As a Pacific nation, we must ensure that the Pacific countries get the support they need to\nadapt to the devastating effects of climate change and their changing environment – a problem they contributed very little to. Access\n\nto climate finance is a matter of justice: those who have contributed least to the causes of the problem are typically the most\nvulnerable to its impacts and have the least resources to respond. New Zealand must demonstrate global leadership and match its\n\nbold vision for lower carbon emissions at home by having an equally ambitious climate change strategy abroad. While consensus\nacross political parties is preferred, any cross-party agreement should not be achieved at the cost of strong climate law. Climate\n\nchange is the greatest challenge facing humanity. It would be wrong to have broad agreement on weak law, when what is urgently\nneeded to address the problem is strong law. The world needs pathways to transformational change if we are to avoid catastrophic\nwarming. This is the scale of the challenge. The science is clear: the only way we can succeed is with big ambition. New Zealand\nmust be bold and pass strong law for the sake of our precious earth and future generations.

  "Get on with it, and put up some real strawman questions that we can practically comment on. Where are the questions re agricultural\nemissions? What are the implications for the economy on an all gases scenario? Would it entail a radical move from pastoral\n\nagriculture? Is it better for NZ to feed the world on its relatively low carbon agricultural model, or should we reduce our production and\nemissions to the level that we can manage on a consumption basis? (Refer to the consumption model for carbon emissions that MfE\n\nreports on and is referenced in the Thinkstep anaylsis https://www.thinkstep.com/content/carbon-footprint-new-zealands-built-\nenvironment-hotspot-or-not , ie 19% from nutrition, 20% from built environment and 44% from transport, which is radically different\n\nfrom how we report to the IPCC). Secondly, please don't undervalue the change that can be undertaken by individuals and\ncommunities, particularly in relation to energy emissions. Include energy on a consumption basis (as above, 20%) and give relative\nemphasis to buildings, which according to the IPCC has the biggest potential for reducing carbon emissions, largely because they are\n\nso inefficient compared with transport and industry. (Refer https://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-\nreport/ar5/wg3/ipcc_wg3_ar5_chapter9.pdf : In summary, buildings represent a critical piece of a low-carbon future and a global\n\nchallenge for integration with sustainable development (robust evidence, high agreement). Buildings embody the biggest unmet\nneed for basic energy services, especially in developing countries, while much existing energy use in buildings in developed\n\ncountries is very wasteful and inefficient. Existing and future buildings will determine a large proportion of global energy demand.\nThird, take into account behaviour change as well as improvement in energy efficiency when designing those interventions. The way\nwe use our buildings, cars, and especially our attitudes towards overseas travel, is at least as important as making those\n\nmodes/infrastructure more efficient to operate.

There is very little available for the average person (especially those not university\neducated) to know how they can wok out a carbon footprint, which lifestyle changes will create the most reduction in their emissions\n\netc. I am well versed in Climate issues and it's hard even for myself. International travel is one of the greatest culprits but I know lots of\npeople who travel and have no idea of the significance. Equally there are known barriers to people taking action on climate change\n\nand these need to be directly addressed with input from people with psychological, educational and marketing expertise . The sense\nof despair people experience with the enormity of the issue causes people to switch off. The effects seem distant and aren't yet very\ntangible, but sadly it will be too late once they are. People influenced by others who don't appear to be taking action, or they believe\n\nit's all up to the government. They also hope that technology will save us. Research on this is easily available and must be heeded.\nBack to Legislation. The Westpac bank recent report concluded that it will never be easy to introduce strategies to reduce carbon\n\nemissions, but more importantly it is easier, and more economical to start now rather than wait. People and businesses, left to their\nown devices are known to act slowly over threats of a distant nature. Well considered legislation like a Zero Carbon Act is an essential\n\nfirst step and lever to ensure New Zealand businesses and families meet their targets for reducing carbon emissions.",

  "I would like to see the New Zealand Government's open recognition that the world's climate has always changed, and that there is\nstill no verifiable scientific proof that mankind has an ability to influence the normal climate change patterns to any significance. The\n\nclimate has changed significantly in the geologically recent past, without mankind's inputs. Hence in the absence of scientifically\nverifiable proof that mankind can affect the earth's climate, spending trillions of Dollars to attain something which is fraught with\nuncertainty and many vested interest groups without a public referendum is premature. There are numerous examples of deliberate\n\nscientific fraud perpetrated to alarm ordinary citizens about climate change, for instance by alarmist proponents like Mr Al Gore. There\nis far too much alarmism which in many cases is driven by funding models that many scientists have come to rely on to pursue their\n\ninterests. True science is never settled ( https://www.wsj.com/articles/climate-science-is-not-settled-1411143565 ), and the vitriol by\nmany of these alarmist scientists, such as the recently convicted fraudster Michael Mann of infamous hockey stick fraud, and Al\n\nGore's \"you can do this at home\" fraud clearly show that real science is being stifled and denied. Name calling by alarmists does\nnothing to further true science, and labels like \"climate denier\" is a reflection of an inability to grasp the inconvenient reality that no\nscientist has ever claimed the climate doesn't change. Climate has always changed, and will continue to do so driven by elements\n\ncompletely out of the control of mankind. To name a few : The sun, the earth's orbital changes, volcanoes under the sea and above\nthe sea, and catastrophic events like significant sized meteorite impacts. None of these can be influenced by any spending by any\n\ngovernment. Instead of wasting trillions of Dollars on chasing ghosts, there ought to be a focus on expenditure which benefits\nmankind in significant areas such as health, food production, poverty alleviation, and peace.",

I think we need to consider other factors, other than the economy as a benchmark for how ambitious our targets are, like\n\nhealth and wellbeing of the populace. We can advance the economy while causing detrimental health effects if we’re not careful. I\nthink that any plans made should not impact our biodiversity negatively. We should actively plan to support those who will be most\n\naffected by this transition, either by physical or social impacts. I think local government needs more support in their local planning for\nmitigation and adaptation of climate change. I think compliance across all aspects of local government needs to be reviewed in order\n\nto meet our future challenges and goals. I think it will be highly likely that the Insurance sector will start to make the biggest impact in\nadapting to climate change impacts (and thereby forcing the hands of many developers, local bodies, individuals and communities). I\nthink it would be wise to be on the same page as the insurance industry, as they are heeding the scientific evidence and future\n\nclimate models in ways that others are not yet. They potentially have the most to lose, from a monetary perspective, so they are\nfurther ahead in this area. I hope to see significant levels of support for our agricultural sector in this transition, as they will arguably be\n\nmost effected by the decisions we make now. I am heartened DairyNZ and others are supporting this Act. I think communication\nneeds to be clearer on the far reaching \"costs\" and implications of NOT acting in our most ambitious pursuit of a zero carbon\neconomy. While we transition into this carbon zero economy I look forward the narrative including climate positive/carbon negative\n\nindustry, so we create a stream of businesses that are taking more carbon than they produce. That aren't just forestry or large scale\ncarbon sequestering. I think we need to escalate the circular economy in New Zealand, rapidly. I think we'll excel in the circular\n\neconomy, especially if there is a push from central government to develop in this area.

Imagine selling our livestock methane vaccines to the US – huge return on investment!\nDevelop an electric car/tractor industry here, subsidise if you have to, and stop all mass imports of second hand cars. 2. I have\nreservations about land use change (assuming this means pastoral farming to forestry) as a mechanism for addressing climate\n\nchange for the following reasons: a. There is time to address methane levels, and a genuine will by farmers to address climate\nchange. Farmers experience the effects of climate change every day, every year. They need to be a key part of finding a solution,\n\nrather than having it imposed on them as land use change. b. The dairy industry will do, and is already proactively doing, what is has\nto in order to remain in business. This drive to survive will foster innovation. c. We need to preserve the option to be competitive in\n\nfuture land-based industries. Imagine, for instance, a world that demands llama or alpaca fibre, possum fur or wool instead of\nsynthetic fibres. New Zealand is already good at these small-scale industries, so it would be a backward step to lose this capacity\n\nthrough land use change. d. Climate change may create opportunities for NZ's temperate climate to provide more food to the world\nthrough horticulture. Land use change may restrict this option and push up the price of arable land. 3. I have concerns about the\nimpacts on low-income households, especially rural poor: a. Low-income families should receive a subsidy for electric cars & home\n\ninsulation (already partially done through previous home insulation initiatives). b. Rural (lifestyle & urban too if they wish) households\nneed the option to be self-sufficient rather than be forced to rely on electricity or gas (expensive and often not available in rural areas)\n\nso they can stay healthy and warm during winter power cuts, for instance. Innovative small scale technologies such as solar panels\nand wind mills could be subsidised on proof of removal of log burners or diesel generators.

We need to understand the effect of Space Weather and the effect of the sun\nbeing at a solar minimum on the planet. The weather is changing on every planet in our solar system not just Earth. This is easily\n\nverifiable and noted by NASA and other space agencies around the world. So are we sure that it is the CO2 causing the climate to\nchange? Greenhouse effect is definitely real but is it really as bad as we are being made to believe? People don't want to accept that\n\nin order to get research grants you have to not go too far outside established theory. Who decides who gets the research grants?\nJust like Doctors promoted smoking or the Catholic Church refused to accept a heliocentric model scientists can and do get it wrong\n\nsometimes at a grand scale. When we look at the biggest polluters in the world they are not those being most targeted by climate\nchange law. This is because they are so called 'developing nations' such as China and India.Now USA totally withdrew from the Paris\nAccords. Although they have made commitments and are making some token gestures they continue to pollute on a scale that\n\ndwarfs NZ. Even if we were to purposefully pollute and emit carbon as much as we could we couldn't ever hope to match even a tiny\nportion of what they output. Right now our economy isn't doing well. 15% GST on basic food items, increasing fuel tax, ignoring our\n\nnatural gas reserves and other natural resources, and other taxes are making NZ an unproductive nation where people cannot/don't\nwant to open businesses. Poor people are hurting and even living in cars. Having to beg the government for assistance as there\n\naren't enough jobs for them to get a decent wage. We are not in any way big enough to be considered part of this problem where it is\nworth hurting our economy. We are not a rich nation. We are far poorer than other nations which are considered developing and falling\nfurther behind. We need to make sure our economy is strong otherwise our emissions certainly will drop if we enter into a Venezuela\n\ntype situation. For example if something like Mad Cow Disease broke out here think of what a position we would be in. This is not the\nonly scenario we should be considering. An Earthquake in Auckland which damaged the harbor bridge is another example of\n\nsomething that would cripple us economically.

  "Annual mandatory targets should b e established for carbon emissions, with measures for correcting and penalising missed targets.\n\nThe emissions target should be zero by 2040 and continuing to zero or less by 2050. In comparison with other economies which\nseem to be being used as benchmarks New Zealand has a relatively easy task. Thus there is no need to put things off to 2050,\nregardless whether 2050 is or is not a very plausible target for other countries. Without a mandatory annual plan a long term target\n\nsuch as 2040 has little meaning, even if such a target is one of the points on the implied curve. Without a mandatory annual plan\nsectors which may have to be reduced or eliminated will experience no pressure to take any action. This is true enough for any\n\nactivity, but we are unfortunate in having a small number of large rather inflexibly established players. For such there is a clear\nadvantage in looting their sectors in advance of a long term problem which will not go away, while influencing governments to direct\n\nattention elsewhere. A carbon budgeting system should be established with no convertibility between money and carbon, in effect a\nparallel currency. If trading between carbon and money is allowed it is naive to think that the intelligent and unscrupulous people in\n\nthe financial sector will not run rings around conflicted and malleable politicians. It is unfortunate that our national culture has become\ntotally fiscalised, so that it is difficult to imagine any other mechanism that the public would understand. In some rather pedantic\nsense, trading could take place, but only in the same sense that at present some people may think it worthwhile to, for example,\n\ncommit crimes. So missed targets might for example involve monetary fines of more than profits made. The basic supply for a carbon\ncurrency would in effect be related to the emission targets. This raises some interesting possibilities. An example is currency\n\ndisappearing if not used, which is a quite conventional idea. Another would be use of the currency to improve people's standard of\nliving - for example as a reward to allow a non-consuming improved lifestyle such as fewer working hours. It is almost an insult to the\n\nvictims of economic policies of the recent past to discuss concerns about household incomes. New Zealand has grotesque income\ninequality, which if left unaddressed make any changes involving emissions changes a minor factor in the general misery. On the\npositive side, the available task of rebuilding a balanced economy can be used to create employment and to restore standards of\n\nliving. As regards our international role it is often supposed, in effect, that New Zealand is so small it can hope to operate unnoticed,\nor that our image is so good that we can get away with anything. However, any discussion of carbon emissions which does not\n\nacknowledge that the problem is linked to the disaster of global overpopulation is irresponsible. Purely in terms of self interest, even if\nNew Zealand transited to zero or even negative emissions we still have much the same serious problem. Certainly, we could feel\n\nvirtuous and have fewer cars, less pointless work, better food and housing and so on as a consequence of a zero carbon economy,\nbut extreme climatic events will still be a rolling disaster. Just how overpopulation can be addressed may not be immediately obvious\n\nbut is has to be considered. There is even the possibility of providing a model for other countries, though that might be laughable at\npresent. Targets for population decrease in New Zealand, involving if necessary resources to address the necessary demographic\nchanges, could be set. Equally, New Zealand could do much more to counteract pressures to increase population worldwide. This\n\nmay seem to be none of our business, but other governments have no scruples about increasing carbon emissions by encouraging\ngrowth and consumption outside their own countries.",

  "I support the creation of an independent climate change commission with strong powers to ensure New Zealand reaches net zero\nemissions by 2050.",
  "Dear Minister I strongly support the passing of a legally binding climate law and the immediate creation of a Zero Carbon Act. I believe\n\nin a net-zero carbon future for New Zealand. We need to make dramatic reductions in our emissions to keep climate change limited\nto 1.5 degrees and protect our native flora and fauna, our societies and our important infrastructures for ourselves and future\n\ngenerations. We must act now to make a positive difference. The key things I support in a Zero Carbon Act are: • an ambitious Act\nthat follows the climate science by covering all gases across all sectors • a target of net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2040 •\n\nan Act that targets the emissions from transport, industrial activity, agriculture and all other sources • an Act that includes emissions\nbudgets that should be at least as important as fiscal budgets, with plans set by the Government to achieve these budgets • an\nindependent Climate Change Commission of experts to monitor emissions and give advice to the Government to keep New Zealand\n\non track for its emissions reduction goals. I support Zero Carbon Act legislation that establishes the goal of limiting warming to 1.5\ndegrees. We should not settle for 2 degrees warming. Any higher limit than 1.5 degrees would result in devastating impacts for Pacific\n\nIsland states and significant extinctions. That is not acceptable. To give us the best possibility of achieving no more than 1.5 degrees\nwarming by the end of the century, we must start making rapid cuts in all greenhouse gas emissions now. I support a net-zero target\n\nof 2040, with the majority of cuts occurring over the next decade. I support all greenhouse gases being included in the law,\nconsistent with international climate frameworks. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) clearly states that methane\nreduction is critical to succeeding in tackling climate change. Our climate law must include all greenhouse gases, including those\n\nfrom our biggest emitting sector - the agricultural sector. I support setting a gross emissions reduction target as well as a net\nemissions reduction target. We cannot rely on planting trees alone to offset our emissions. We must seek to decarbonise our\n\nindustry and transport systems. As the Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment stated in their submission to the Productivity\nCommission, June 2018, page 4: “Each tonne of emissions offset by forestry is a tonne not reduced at source. Relying too heavily on\n\nforestry could lead to continued high levels of gross emissions. Pressure to reduce these after 2050 could entail a more costly and\ndisruptive transition than a deeper transition commenced earlier.” I support the ‘firewall’ principle that New Zealand’s targets must be\n\nachieved by actual reductions in our own domestic emissions and not through the purchase of overseas carbon credits or an over-\nreliance on forests as carbon sinks. I support setting legally binding climate budgets that are set at a bare-minimum ambition, which\nmust be achieved or bettered by government within the prescribed timeframes. While budgets should be binding, policy\n\nrecommendations from the Commission should be just that – recommendations. The world needs pathways to transformational\nchange if we are to avoid catastrophic warming. This is the scale of the challenge. The science is clear: the only way we can succeed\n\nis with big ambition. New Zealand must be bold and pass strong law for the sake of our precious earth and future generations. I\nsupport the establishment of a Climate Change Commission. The commission’s role should include: • devising binding climate\n\nbudgets • identifying the level of reduction for each form of greenhouse gas (long-lived and short-lived) • monitoring adherence to\nthe set ‘firewall’ • monitoring progress towards our targets • monitoring cumulative emissions • advising on adaptation. The Climate\nChange Commission should provide advice to the New Zealand government. To ensure transparency and accountability, I support\n\nthe Government being required to table all reports from the Climate Change Commission to Parliament. I support the Government\npreparing a National Climate Risk Assessment. The Government must be required to produce an Adaption Programme to address\n\nthe climate risks identified in the National Climate Risk Assessment.",

Options could include a commitment, in collaboration with the MOH, encouraging vegetable based diets with the\ninherent spin-off effects of improved health such as a reduction in heart disease and bowel cancer. Also there could be commitment\n\nto funding R&D into less methane-producing feed for stock and for genetic selection for less gas producing breeds. Another option\nis proactive support for changing land use such as converting farms to horticulture or forestry. This could have further benefits on\nwater and air quality, especially tree planting on waterways.",
  "There is no consideration of consumption-based emissions. This is a gap. Whilst the focus should be on territorial emissions (not\nleast as we have more control over them, and the global carbon accounting system is based on them), it is important that we monitor\n\nand report on consumption-based emissions too (albeit there is less certainty over such emissions). Typically for developed\ncountries, consumption-based emissions are higher than territorial-based emissions (although this may not be the case for NZ, with\nits unique emissions profile). We need to know that our overall impacts, from all our activities, are reducing. Of course, if there is\n\ncomparable emissions reduction action globally then we can expect the ‘embodied’ emissions of imported goods and services to\nreduce as NZ’s territorial-based emissions reduce. But, there is no guarantee that this will be the case, and the rate of reduction is\n\nlikely to differ between countries.

  "RECOMMENDATION: Because the proposed name of this bill, namely the Zero Carbon Act, does not clearly or fully describe the\nconcern or the nature of this bill (firstly, nitrous oxide and water vapour are also greenhouse gases but do not contain carbon, and\n\nsecondly, the intent is not to emit zero carbon in greenhouse gases, which would probably be not only impossible but actually lethal\nto all plant life and subsequently all life including human life if achieved), the bill should be renamed the Global Warming and Climate\n\nChange Mitigation and Adaptation Act. If that RECOMMENDATION is not acceptable, at least call it the “Net Zero Carbon Act”.\nRECOMMENDATION: Because of the existential threat of global warming and climate change, the New Zealand Parliament should\nestablish the Zero Carbon Act (or Net Zero Carbon Act, or preferably the Global Warming and Climate Change Mitigation and\n\nAdaptation Act) as ‘entrenched’ legislation requiring at least a 75% majority for amendment or repeal. As well, the Act should prohibit\nthe amendment of the clause expressing the 2050 net zero greenhouse gas emissions target. The vote should be a conscience\n\nvote not subject to political party voting rules and procedures (whipping). This recommendation is intended to reduce significantly\nthe effect of the three-year electoral term with its consequential yo-yoing of political party policy changes. RECOMMENDATION: The\n\nZero Carbon Act (preferably named the Global Warming and Climate Change Mitigation and Adaptation Act), or “the Act”, should\ncontain clauses requiring all other subsequent legislation to comply with the Act so that, after it has become law, it will be one of the\nlegal foundations of our society, like the electoral law and the human rights law.

  "I worry about our local body politicians who are incapable of understanding the issues and don't even believe it is happening. They\nthink throwing rocks at the sea will fix it! We need the government to take control as this bill proposes.",
  "I work in environmental politics and I am horrified at the behaviour of NZ governments towards climate change. It does not fit the NZ I\nwould like to live in - one that is environmentally sustainable - our way of life depends on it. It is time NZ stepped up and took critical\n\naction to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions - not just offset them. The time to act is NOW.",
  "It is time for New Zealand to lead again. We have a history of global leadership: we were the first country to give women the vote and\n\nthe first to become nuclear free. It is time to take another giant step towards climate justice globally. New Zealand has demonstrated\nglobal leadership with our commitment to stopping oil and gas exploration – now let us continue that moral leadership and include\n\ntransparency in what and how we support climate change efforts abroad.",
  "This is an important first step for the government to be undertaking, regardless of whether it actually ends-up a success. We have\n\ngot to try.",
  "(In support of page 39) The government should implement policy that would assist vulnerable communities to adapt, since many of\nthem will be more adversely affected. Businesses that generate high emissions should innovate and develop in an agile way.\n\nUltimately, to succeed, stakeholders in all of society will need to do their part. It will be important for the Bill to start with well-informed\nand meaningful policies.",
  "Climate change is real and needs urgent and real solutions. An Independent Climate Change Commission of experts is urgently\nneeded to consider all aspects pertaining to Climate Change. Their views and advice must be binding on any change of Government,\n\nif we are to have any chance of mitigating the negative impacts of climate change, both in New Zealand and globally.",
  "Let's get started.",
  "I do not agree with tree planting as an off-setting mechanism. We face catastrophic consequences NOW and trees take decades to\ngrow. We need to reduce our use and our population.

  "1. Climate change is one of the biggest challenges facing people in poverty in New Zealand and in developing countries. It would be\n\nunethical for NZ to ignore the impact climate change is having on our neighbours in the Pacific and across the developing world. 2.\nClimate Change is a global problem – it cannot be tackled by countries in isolation. In our farming families view, New Zealand must\n\ndemonstrate global leadership and match its bold domestic emissions reduction agenda: by having an equally ambitious climate\nchange strategy abroad. 3. Access to climate finance is a matter of climate justice – those who have contributed least to the causes\nof climate change are typically the most vulnerable to its impacts and have the least resources to respond. This is unacceptable and\n\nmust be remedied. 4. We must take responsibility for our global emissions and the climate impacts that we have contributed to. It’s\nvery important that all New Zealanders have their say on how we make the shift to a zero carbon future here in New Zealand but in\n\nour view we must also help the world’s most vulnerable communities across the Pacific adjust to the impacts on climate change. 5.\nWe must ensure that the Zero Carbon Bill is transparent. This means the bill must include a requirement to produce annual reports\n\nabout New Zealand’s international climate change contributions in order to ensure that the Pacific countries get the support they\nneed and can plan to adapt to their changing environment. 6.Transparency in the Bill will promote public engagement and political\naccountability. Kiwis will then be able to understand the international contributions we are making and as a nation, we will be able to\n\nstand tall that we are supporting our Pacific neighbours adapt to their climate change reality. 7. It is time for New Zealand to lead\nagain. We have a history of global leadership: we were the first country to give women the vote, the first to become nuclear free and\n\nwe have no commercial GE food crops or animals, no cloning of animals. We have a valuable ZERO TOLERANCE Policy for any GE\ncontent in imported seeds, including adventitious presence.. It is time to take another giant step towards climate justice globally. 8.\n\nNew Zealand has demonstrated global leadership with our commitment to stopping oil and gas exploration – now let us continue that\nmoral leadership and include transparency in what and how we support climate change efforts abroad. 9. We ask that the Zero\nCarbon Bill prioritizes supporting the most vulnerable people in the Pacific. 10. NO new coal mines in the North Island or South Island.\n\nWe support the Minister of Conservation Hon Eugenie Sage's recent excellent decision, DECLINING the application by Stevenson\nMining Ltd/ RAngitira Developments Ltd for a new open cast coal mine on public conservation lands (in an Outstanding Landscape,\n\nabove Westport). The Stevenson Mining LTD/ Rangitira Developments proposal for a new open cast coal mine in the Buller District\nCouncil \"Water Conservation Reserve\" (approximately 100 hectares) and on our public conservation lands (12 hectares) must be\n\nstopped in its entirety. It would increase the Bullers negative contribute to climate change, put the town of Westport and the Buller /\nWest Coast in general- particularly but not limited to coastal communities already experiencing severe erosion- further at risk from\n\nviolent storms. We support the new government putting a ban on all new coal mines. In our view, ensuring that existing mines are\noperated to best practice standards, and that full robust remediation is done to best environmental standards, will retain and create\nethical jobs (during the period during which we transition to safe and clean, renewable energy). Thank you for the opportunity to\n\nmake a submission, I wish to be heard at any hearing that may occur. Thank you!",
  "While the 2050 date and the idea of staged five year emission budgets might convey a calm, considered process we need to keep in\nmind that right now in almost any given week in New Zealand we have housing, infrastructure and agricultural output being destroyed\n\nby weather related cold, drought, flooding and wind with invasive species being enabled and diseases spreading. What we might plan\nat our pace within our considerations of GDP and 'political reality' actually has no relation to the speed at which the climate is\nchanging and the impacts are appearing. To do anything less than put into legislation the most ambitious emissions reductions we\n\ncan is to lose any chance of getting ahead of the pace of the changes we've already started. We throw not only caution to the wind,\nbut the basis of our civilisation.",
  "Man-made climate change has simply been assumed to be true without a rigorous, impartial scientific debate. Claiming that the\n'scientific community' has reached consensus is simply wrong, especially when skeptics are pushed off the media platform. The real\n\nquestion is whether or not we should make any laws about carbon dioxide at all. Consequently, the great majority of these questions\nare really quite irrelevant to the reality of the situation. Please just halt the zero carbon bill as it is, put it aside, and use the money to\nprovide warm, dry, securing housing for the most destitute New Zealanders and their families.",
  "I am a retired farmer from Cambridge. I wish to make a submission to the Our Climate, Your Say consultation on the Zero Carbo bill. As\n\na farmer, and like my fellow farmers, I have had a lifetime interest in climate and its changes. It had, and has, a major influence on my\noccupation and the profitability of our enterprise. My interest in the subject of climate and climate change intensified from the period\n\nwhere it was indicated that agriculture was responsible for 48% of the GHG emissions in New Zealand. How so, and why? I started my\nresearch by contacting a scientist who was present and involved in the Kyoto negotiations, Richard Christie, Executive Director of the\n\nSouth Island Dairying Development Centre. As a farmer, I was frustrated by the fact that under IPCC rules, no mitigating factors are\nconsidered in the protocols New Zealand agreed to at Kyoto. The difficulty was, according to Richard Christie, that it would have been\ndifficult to establish those protocols, particularly in relation to New Zealand agriculture, in the negotiations. Richard’s final comment in\n\nhis email to me was the telling one – “Those negotiations seem to have much more to do with politics thant (sic) they do with saving\nthe planet”. I was to later challenge Prof Jacqui Rowarth of Waikato University at a public meeting as she spoke of the need for\n\nagriculture to prepare to meet commitments in GHG reductions. I later discussed the issue at length with Jacqui. To my amazement I\ndiscovered that Jacqui had no knowledge of the actual proportions of the atmosphere carbon dioxide and methane represented, nor\n\nwas she aware of these gases being measured and recorded here in New Zealand since 1960, nor carbon dioxide’s minute annual\nincrements (see table below). In New Zealand atmospheric gases are monitored and measured by our Ministry of the Environment at\nBaring Head, in Wellington. When I advised Jacqui that carbon dioxide was 0.043% of the atmosphere, a mere trace gas, and vital for\n\nthe survival of life as we know it on this planet, in astonishment Jacqui exclaimed – “OMG!” I was stunned by Jacqui’s reaction. In\ndisbelief she asked me if what I said was true. I advised Jacqui to check the information out herself. She later did. I still wonder how\n\nmany of the advocates for reductions in carbon dioxide know this fact. To clarify – that is one four hundred and thirtieth of one percent\nof the atmosphere! Halve that amount of carbon dioxide to 0.02%, and all life as we know it will cease to exist. Photosynthesis stops\n\nat this level! Carbon dioxide, a trace gas, is the building block of life as we know it, our environment, our food, our oxygen. It is\nessential to life. Despite what some would promote, our atmosphere is not awash with this gas. It is measured and monitored. 1850\n\n1960 2012 Co2 ATMOSPHERIC PERCENTAGE 0.0425% 0.0360% 0.0430% WORLDWIDE MOTOR VEHICLE REGISTRATIONS Nil\n126,888,000 1,114,558,000 ATMOSPHERIC CO2 INCREMENT ANNUALLY 1.5-1.6 ppm/Yr 1.5-1.6 ppm/Yr The interesting observation of\nthe tabled data – factual and recorded - is that there appears to be very little relationship with the combustion engine and the actual\n\natmospheric content of carbon dioxide. There was a drop indicated in the 1960 figure which could corelate to the quiet industrial\nperiod of 15 years following World War Two, suggesting minute increments as a result of human activity. In preparation to put my\n\nsubmission into writing I emailed the advertised email address on the Consultation website with the following request on the 25th\nJune: “Could someone on the Climate Change Team please supply me with a reference, or references, to the specific and conclusive\n\npeer reviewed research that directly attributes and clearly demonstrates scientifically, that atmospheric carbon dioxide, and the\nreduction of this gas from its present level at approximately 0.043% of the atmosphere will directly and conclusively change the\nworld’s climate to the exclusion of all other potential causes. I would also be interested to know, to what level should this gas be\n\nreduced to satisfy a “Zero Carbon” policy.” Being advised after a follow up that the matter was being worked on, I was eventually\ndirected to an IPCC 5th Assessment Report and told “This report represents the global scientific consensus on climate change,\n\nwhich the New Zealand Government accepts.” Simply, the Climate Change Consultation team were unable to specifically answer my\nrequest, not that I fully expected the team to be able to provide that answer or answers. So why would a government accept that\n\nassessment? How much research has it carried out? I then elected to contact the secretariat of IPCC in Geneva and made the same\nrequest. Mxolisi Shongwe of the IPCC Sectretariat finally responded. Again, I was presented with two website links outlining the\n\nAssessment report 5, Chapter 10 wherein I was promised I would find my answer. I was faced with a raft of modelling and\nassessments in a report spanning. The reports did not answer the specific information I requested. I was confronted with an\nelaborate raft of IPCC assessments all of which in some form or another endeavour to “fingerprint” changes in temperature and link\n\nthem to GHG’s. The most common term used by all the authors was ‘likely’ or ‘most likely’. Much, if not all of the data published was\neither presumptions or forced modelling. There was no established and demonstrated fact showing clear and proven links that the\n\nminiscule actual and measured increment of a trace gas, carbon dioxide, in any way, was capable of being a major cause of climate\nchange. Analysing the actual data in the table above, and assuming the consensus of contributors to the IPCC case was that the\n\nincrease in atmospheric carbon dioxide was the source of global climate change, this would actually mean that from 1960 when the\nabove records were made by the Ministry of the Environment to the 2012 level and beyond, a span of 52 years and beyond – an\nincrease of atmospheric carbon dioxide by 16.28% of one four hundred and thirtieth of 1% of this trace gas is causing global climate\n\nchange. Little wonder that the IPCC secretariat was unable to answer my question! So where from here? Nowhere in the official IPCC\nliterature did I find any mention of, or reference to, a known and significant natural cause of climate change., the Milankovitch orbital\n\nvariations. Following study, the National Research Council of the US National Academy of Sciences has embraced the Milankovitch\nCycle Model ...orbital variations remain the most thoroughly examined mechanism of climatic change on time scales of tens of\n\nthousands of years and are by far the clearest case of a direct effect of changing insolation on the lower atmosphere of Earth\n(National Research Council, 1982). Orbital variations of the planet, ie. changes in orbital eccentricity affect the earth-sun distance.\n\nCurrently, a difference of only 3% (5 million kilometres) exists between closest approach (perihelion), which occurs on or about 3\nJanuary, and furthest departure (aphelion), which occurs on or about 4 July . The other is variation in Axial Obliquity. The change in the\ntilt of the earth’s axis (obliquity) effects the magnitude of seasonal change. At higher tilts the seasons are more extreme, and at lower\n\ntilts they are milder. The current tilt according to NASA is 23.5 degrees nearing its highest tilt. We are currently observing apparently\ngreater extremes in climate which would be consistent with the above known facts In summary • There is no such thing as normal\n\nwhen we consider climate. • A change in climate – which, forever changes - is to be expected. That we, living on a planet hurtling\nthrough space at 36,000 mph, and expect it to fly a precise orbit is nonsense. • The world is growing in population, we live in a time\n\nof instant communication and graphic video of what is occurring. If I had had a modern cell phone in the 1950’s I could have recorded\nflooding on our own property that has never occurred since. The result of that flood instigated the Waikato River Flood protection\nscheme, dissipating these events in a managed way. My video from one particular “cloud burst” would have flashed across the world\n\nlike what we see occasionally today. It was spectacular. As our communities and population grow, worldwide and here, there are\nplaces that just should not exist as and where they are. For example, Edgecumbe in the Bay of Plenty will flood again. It is built\n\nalongside a river with a huge catchment on a flood plain. Whanganui is similar. The world is embarking on change such as electric\nvehicles and the management of the environment and resources. That is good. Our resources are finite. To believe that Carbon\nDioxide is the cause of climate change, simply beggars belief when one considers fact rather than hypothetical modelling. I\n\nunderstand the difficulty of having to meet obligations previously entered, however I would rather see New Zealand take a measured\nand thoroughly critiqued approach to “the scientific consensus” of the IPCC Assessment Reports which show its authors and\ncontributors qualitative level of confidence from very low (more predominantly) to very high (seldom). As Richard Christie said, “This\n\nhas much more to do with politics than they do with saving the planet” Therefore, I pose my question directly to the Climate Change\nPublic consultancy and to the Government which accepts this “scientific” consensus, and that is simply: Either the Government or\n\nthe Climate Change Team please supply me (and the New Zealand public) with a reference, or references, to the specific and\nconclusive peer reviewed research that directly attributes and clearly demonstrates scientifically, that atmospheric carbon dioxide,\nand the reduction of this gas from its present level at approximately 0.043% of the atmosphere will directly and conclusively change\n\nthe world’s climate to the exclusion of all other potential causes. I expect, and demand a specific, conclusive answer that would justify\nthe economic cost of current solutions that are being promoted. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss this directly with the\n\ncommission if it were possible.",

  "Tourism is a huge and ever-growing component of our economy. Tourists are inherently high emitters of GHGs.

Perhaps the Government could consider some form of small visitor levy, the proceeds of which are used\nto contribute to forestry planting/purchasing international carbon units.",
  "My main concern is that we have spent decades talking a lot about climate change and doing very little. Please move as quickly as\npossible on passing this legislation and establishing the new Climate Change Commission. Prominent British economist Nicholas\nStern warned 22 years years ago that if we delay too long then the scale of change required will not be achievable in a few short\n\nyears, whereas if we start ASAP the large scale of change will be spread more comfortably over decades. If we had started then we\nwould have had 44 years to mid-century and needed to reduce emissions by about 1.5% a year but now we have only 32 years and\n\nthe required rate of change has jumped to 2.2% which I think will be very tough but achievable. In April I set this argument out in a\nletter to the editor which I attach below (also sent to James Shaw as Minister). Note that at that time I thought that the intention was\n\nto halve emissions by mid century - now the intention has ramped up to 100% (at least net) but I have doubts that this can be\nachieved in reality: From: Graeme Easte                            Subject: Climate change action not premature - urgent action\nlong overdue Date: 23 April 2018 at 10:51:54 AM NZST To: letters@listener.co.nz Dear Sir, The new government’s move from vague\n\nlong-term targets for reducing carbon emissions to real action is criticized as premature by climate change deniers. On the contrary,\nafter decades of procrastination, encouraged by the same deniers, the time for action has now become urgent. As top economist\n\nNicholas Stern reported in 2006, the math’s are actually fairly simple and easily understood - the sooner we begin cutting our\nemissions the less painful the process will be. But continuing to delay will eventually require a considerably faster rate of reduction. If\n\nwe truly intend to halve carbon emissions by mid-century then we have 32 years left to achieve it. Spreading the reductions evenly\nover that period would require an average 2.1% cut each year – hard to achieve but possible. We blew our chance for an easier\n\ntransition back in the 1990s when we could have had over 50 years in which to honour our Kyoto commitments with average annual\ncuts of less than 1.4%. But if we delay starting for another 5 years then the annual cuts required go up to 2.5% and a 10 year delay\npushes the rate up over 3%. Sustained cuts at these levels could well stall the economy. Yours faithfully, Graeme Easte 71a Martin\n\nAvenue, Mount Albert Email: Graeme@pastfinder.co.nz Phones: (09) 815-9000 or 027-209-7565 Postscript (not intended for\npublication): Some comparative numbers, based on the stated aim of halving our emissions by 2050 - if we had started actual\n\nreductions in: 1983 there would be 67 years – average annual reduction required = 1.0% 2000 there would be 50 years – average\nannual reduction required = 1.4% 2006 there would be 44 years – average annual reduction required = 1.5% 2012 there would be\n\n38 years – average annual reduction required = 1.8% - if we start actual reductions in: 2018 there will be 32 years – average annual\nreduction required = 2.1% 2023 there would be 27 years – average annual reduction required = 2.5% 2028 there would be 22 years\n– average annual reduction required = 3.0% 2034 there would be 16 years – average annual reduction required = 4.0% 2036 there\n\nwould be 14 years – average annual reduction required = 5.0% These figures are compounded year-on-year – much like compound\ninterest in reverse. Cuts of more than 2.2-2.5% will be almost impossible to sustain year on year without “tanking” the economy -\n\nwhich is why we have literally run out of time and must make a start this year or acknowledge that the target of 50% will be not be\nachievable by mid-century but will have to be pushed out into the following decade (and possibly later if future governments slow\n\nthings down.)",

  "It' a complete nonsense. The so-called scientific consensus is irrelevant. Science is about data. The FACT is that such data is publicly\n available from authoritative sources. This includes organisations such as NASA (including its various satellites such as the NSIDC) ,\n\n the EPA and even Google Earth. Lets take a simple example. The NSIDC commentary on Antarctic sea ice indicates that the continent\n has been gaining an additional 1.8% of ice over the past 3 decades. When you follow a link from NSIDC to Google Earth you are\n presented with a time lapse series of images (1979-2018) that shows absolutely no change in the amount of ice present in\n\n Antarctica and yet we have been told only recently that we should all be alarmed by the impact of climate change in the region. Also\nwe have been told that we have been facing unprecedented levels of record temperatures. This information is derived from tortured\n\ndata that comes from surface based temperature measurements. Satellite measurements are infinitely more accurate and can\nmonitor temperatures anywhere in the world. The UAH (University of Huntsville Alabama) show that temperatures are not tracking up\n\nand if anything are trending down. These are only a small number of examples. There are many more.

  "Food and fibre producers in NZ are concerned at a fundamental level with Kaitiakitanga and Legacy. They will want to adopt and adapt\nto this legislation. The Government needs to consider how they can best support farmers to make the required changes, without\n\npushing their costs of production up so much that their customers start buying from higher emitting competitors. There is no point in\nputting a sector out of business that is globally an emissions efficient system. The goal should be to support greater levels of\nemissions efficiencies in that system. I would also like to highlight the Government's need to prioritise training and capability for\n\npeople - we will need scientists and technology developers, but we might also need different primary sector skills or retraining\nfarmers if we end up with land use changes. Finally, I want to exhort the Government to consider this legislation alongside the full\n\ngambit of environmental issues facing food and fibre producers and on which they have worked hard already. There is no gain if we\nsacrifice water quality work or biodiversity in order to reduce emissions. Policy to reduce emissions should ensure it does not have\n\nadverse environmental outcomes in other aspects. Equally, BIOSECURITY needs to be kept front of mind when adopting or\nembracing technology for emissions reductions, especially from off-shore.",

Many do not appreciate the implications that this will bring to many businesses and communities. We\n\nmust go through this process using our heads so that we have a carefully planned approach, giving time for adjustment and remain\nwith sustainable communities into the future. It must be remembered that the overall goal here is for reduced total global emissions.\n\nWe are one of the most efficient producers of agriculture product in the world. Any drastic actions which reduced our abilities to\nprovide this food to the world would likely result in extra production being picked up by a less efficient producing nation and therefore\nnegatively impact on total global emissions. While agriculture must play it part, science has indicated that we do not need to get to\n\nzero short lived gas emissions to stabilise global temperatures, therefore don't over burden our economy.",

Vision needs to lead, not the economy. The economy needs to transition in a way that supports the vision.

The current situation makes it difficult for whole demographics to participate in the economy, education, or other\nopportunities (see work of Karen Witten et al, on transport-related severance in NZ). Philipp McCann had made a clear case for more\n\naccessible and better functioning cities - I had put some key points and links here: https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/case-cities-new-\nzealands-economy-tamara-bozovic/ (3) better water quality, through decreased dairy and animal farming (I do hope that the biggest\n\ngenerator of pollution will be tackled and that animal-oriented agriculture will transition to plant-based sustainable farming, for\nenvironmental but also moral and ethical reasons). This will have positive outcomes on health but also tourism, matching the \"100%\npure\" label In terms of solutions, the EVs should not be presented as one for cleaner air, given their high emissions of thin particles\n\n(https://www.thenewamerican.com/tech/item/23226-study-electric-vehicles-pollute-more-than-gas-powered-cars ). They are also\nhardly an environmentally-friendly solution at all, given the needs for non renewable materials, roads, further contribution to urban\n\nsprawl and continued need of roads & road renewals. The end of oil will mean the end of asphalt too, but also the need for more\nresource-efficient transport solutions.

If we had had governments then who had listened\nto the warnings, we wouldn't be in this situation now. We could have made changes in energy production then.

  "The methane problem of New Zealand livestock is a doubtful one as the carbon from the air grows plant material which the ruminant\n\neats and it produces methane into the air as a heating gas. This methane will eventually return to carbon to grow more plants to go\naround again as has been happening for millenias. I can see the politics of envy are likely to make the control of methane a tempting\n\nstep for a government to tackle as it will look good internationally and will have a minimal effect on the voter base until the declining\noverseas income from agriculture starts to hit the overall wealth of the population and the country's living standard deteriorates. New\nZealand has approximately 10 million cattle,of which 6 million are dairy and 4 million are beef.From the United Nations Food and\n\nAgriculture figures, the latest world farmed cattle and buffalo population is February 2012 and then there were 1622 million farmed in\nthe world. New Zealand 's farmed cattle share is 0.62% of the world's and our dairy is only 0.37% so we are not a very large\n\ncontributor if methane is a problem.. I heard the prime minister saying we are going to to the the right thing because it is the right\nthing when referring to NZ agricultural emmssions. Agriculture in most other countries is much poorer than ours. Approximately 75 %\n\nof the cattle and buffalos are in developing countries and they are unlikely to follow our example as most peasant farmers must\nremain emitters in order for their families to survive. Their animals not only produce the family food and income but oxen are also\noften used to till the crops and dried cattle dung is often the only fuel that farmers have to cook their food with. Of the other 25% of\n\nworld cattle farmed in the more wealthy nations many are heavily supported by taxpayer subsidies and so they also are unlikely to\nfollow NZ's lead if we add costs to our cattle farmers. Any increase in costs to the farmers of the industrial world would likely lead to an\n\nincrease in demand for subsidy support both in Europe and North America. That would be hard to sell to voting taxpayers of an\nelectorate in a democracy. On top of that there are lots other farmed ruminants. Sheep, goats and camels on farms outnumber\n\nfarmed cattle and buffalos. They make up another 2000 millions and many of these are also in developing countries. Then of course\nthere is the problem of how can we control the emissions from all the ruminants that are not farmed but are wandering free and\ngobbling plant material across the world from the giraffes and antelopes in Africa to the reindeer of Siberia. How and who is\n\nresponsible for these emissions? At the same time no country is willing to put an emission tax on jet fuel and make the air travel\nindustry pay for the damage they cause to the atmosphere. Jet travel is convenient for the wealthy of the planet and a luxury the poor\n\ncan never aspire to. It is an indecent squandering of our carbon heritage to benefit the few but it is those same few that make the\ndecisions who use air travel most and so therefore airlines are never likely to be held to account for the damage that jet travel has\n\ncaused.",

And in addition: It has been fundamental to climate change mitigation efforts for decades that one could have a\ndefined emission price and uncertain reduction or a defined reduction and uncertain price. At this late stage in climate change, there\nis no longer any choice. Emissions must be reduced drastically and therefore must be planned for directly rather than through the\n\nmechanism of price signals.

  "Thank you yes. I am very keen to make comment as I do hope my attitude - beliefs will be recorded. I have done months of close\nstudy on this subject. I have studied,equally, both \"sides\" of the debate. I used to be a secondary school teacher, now retired, which\n\nis why I am able to take this time. I used to teach the topic \"Climate Change\". I have read the IPCC reports plus the recent \"Climate\nupdates. What have we learned since the IPCC 5th assessment report\". I understand the reports and I understand why all the\n\ninformation is so extremely persuasive. I believe that the opposing ideas from the scientific( and other) communities is not published.\nI believe that while climate is changing - of course, as it always has, that this is NOT caused by carbon dioxide which is one of the\nlesser of the GHGs.. CO2 is a boon to our planet Earth. Climate warming rate is not unprecedented , we are emerging from a 300 year\n\nwarming period but in the last 18 years climate warming has slowed and the rate does not correspond with the increase in CO2\nwhich has been rising since the 1850s. For 80% of its existence Earth has been warmer than today. Other climate forces have often\n\noverridden the warming effect of CO2 and Greenhouse gases. Man's input to climate warming through carbon emissions is miniscule.\nThe very best explanation for this widely held point of view is in a excellent book which although written by a scientist, Howard\n\nThomas Brady , is fairly accessible to a lay person. Those who hold the prevailing and therefore widely publicised Government and\nacademic viewpoint of worrying manmade global warming have not read this book. it is the only very recent full discussion of every\naspect of the complexity of the multi-cyclical climate systems ( described in science as \"chaotic\") and it explains all aspects of the\n\nover-simplicity of the IPCC's thesis. This I find most disturbing. I am completely\" neutral with no position to protect but I am totally\ndismayed to realise that it is impossible to get any \"opposing\" view published or heard. For this reason I believe our Government is\n\nabout to embark on a most complex \" revolution\" based on a totally incorrect simplistic premise - that of man-made carbon emissions\ncausing global warming. I totally support all efforts to improve the state of our Earth - any action that improves the water, soil, ocean,\n\nair quality etc - ie pollution is totally to be applauded. I believe the other 127 nations who signed the Paris accord are also being\nmislead by the IPCC. I believe most people are innocent of the deceptions and truely believe they can \"see' the effects of (manmade)\n\nwarming and the graphs showing increasing CO2 since 1850 are most persuasive and beguiling. Usually part of the \"silent majority\" ,\nand following months of intense and honest study on this subject I am very insistent that my point of view - which is not uncommon,\nbe registered. Unfortunately very few people are able to undertake this level of personal research as they are genuinely too busy or\n\ninsufficiently educated and therefor only too willing to believe \"what the science community\" is appearing to say. Therefore NZ should\nNOT be a leader in this charade but use our worthy and considerable influence and our precious funds in other directions - pure\n\nresearch and education and of course the development of alternative fuel/power sources. Thank you for the opportunity - I do hope\nthis reaches some objective ears.",

NZs contribution to global carbon dioxide emissions is negligible (close to zero).\nRather than legislate a new emissions target for NZ, focus efforts to convince President Xi Jinping or Prime Minister, Narendra Modi to\n\nfollow your proposed tax theory to reduce CO2 emissions, then your effort would be laudable within your ideological drive. Your\nadvisors knowledge of science is wrong. Use of the expression Carbon Bill and not Carbon Dioxide bill is evidence of that. The target,\n\nif NZ needs one, should be based on settled science. NZ Government have not considered all arguments of the global warming\nscience. It is now common knowledge that global temperatures have not increased in the last 20 years. Other countries (including\n\nIndia and China) still plan to construct coal fired power stations, which will increase CO2 emissions significantly (+40% estimated).

It is easy to measure CO2e from our transport, energy etc -\n\nthese are the low lying fruits, but unfortunately only account for (at best) half of our emissions. Our clothes, chemicals, household\nappliances, the things we consume of a daily basis without thinking probably make up the other half (or 2/3) of our true\n\nenvironmental impact. As most of these things in NZ are imported from elsewhere but 'consumed' in NZ we need to make sure that\nthese are included in our calculations. I do not think currently that they are (other than perhaps their transport. This is depressing for\n2 reasons. 1 - our job already seems daunting enough, the realisation that our CO2e is perhaps twice as large as we think makes the\n\ntask so much bigger. 2 measuring this is near impossible, it will require a full lifecycle analysis of all products imported to NZ.

I would also note that in its current form the document\n\ndoes little to clealy inform the reader of the implications of the different types of gasses being included (is methane increasing\nwarming or not?) or excluded in the bill, and the how these would be taxed and what the resulting social, economic and\n\nenvironemental landscape would look like; the inclusion of the pictorial model hardly does justice to what could be a hugely varied\nand largely unpresidented distortion of the economic environment as we know it. Lastly the reliance of planting trees is highly\n\nconcerning, given that globally planation forestry has increased on an immense scale and is therefore likely at some point to become\ndepressed (potentially disastrously so). There are also many assumed and unqualified assertions in the discussion document\nrelating to the improvement plantation forestry is 'known' to have on water quality, biodiversity and erosion. The government will be\n\naware that this is not true in some landscapes as evidenced by recent examples of erosion prone land suffering catastrophic damage\nfollowing harvest, and the flow-on effects in waterways, research in the space is ongoing. The public requires balanced information\n\nwhich is clear and unbias if they are to make an informed submission, something that the discussion document failed to provide.",

  "New Zealand needs to act on climate change mitigation on the assumption that the countries of the world will achieve their Paris\ncommitments. This essential if we are to avoid setting plans that are unrealistic in relation to what the rest of the world is doing. NZ\n\ncan continue to emit reasonably large amounts of green house gases for a lengthy period of time because of the scope to plant large\nareas of trees as offsets. Very few other countries are in this happy situation so will in fact have to reduce their gross emissions very\n\ndramatically to achieve net zero emissions. As a simple example NZ could achieve net zero by reducing gross emissions from the\npresent 18/19 tonnes per capita to, say, 10 tonnes and offset the remaining 10 tonnes for many years. China currently emits 5\ntonnes per capita but has no chance of offsetting more than a tonne or two per capita even in the short term. Most countries are\n\nmuch closer to the China example than the NZ example so NZ must plan to fit into a world that is much more constrained in its ability\nto produce the goods that NZ currently imports or plans to import in the future. It is all well and good to plan on replacing ICE private\n\nvehicles with EV private vehicles as part of our plan but where are we going to import them from if other countries have higher\npriorities (feeding, clothing, housing, heating and transporting their citizens) than producing goods to export to NZ? Although plans\n\nthat take account of these issues will be more disruptive of NZ society, they will be manageable provided we are doing the planning\nrather than suddenly discovering that the rest of the world is pursuing actions that make our too self-centred plans ineffective. The\n\nessential barrier to taking effective action to reduce NZ's emissions is the reluctance of the current generation to decide on and then\nmake the sacrifices of elements of their high consumption way of life regardless of how much this refusal will damage the lives of\nfuture generations. Understanding this strong psychological commitment to a way of life that is unsustainable in anything except the\n\nvery short term must be the starting point for any planning of mitigation action. Accepting the fundamental importance of the\npsychology in making changes must be taken on board yet this discussion ignores it completely. The ethical need for the current\n\ngeneration to take account of the enormous damage being done to future generations is overwhelmed by our commitment to the\nhigh consumption life style even though this often requires people to hold mutually inconsistent beliefs.",

  "In my opinion, their should be a mechanism that regularly checks on the progress of other comparable countries with similar goals, to\nassess whether they have any new data or expertise that could assist us to achieve our own goals. This could involve two-way\ninformation sharing/cooperation agreements, if not already in place. Additionally, a robust set of mechanisms should be laid out which\n\nwill fully 'air-gap' those who create, enforce, and are directly subject to Zero Carbon Bill policies from the influences of stakeholders\nwho are recognised as having a vested interest in delaying, degrading or obstructing effective climate change policy. I.e. no more\n\nindustry-led cooperation which simply allows companies to hollow out climate policy under the guise of stakeholder engagement,\nand no Cambridge Analytica style influence campaigning by industry groups or individuals to dupe voters or economic sectors into\n\ndegrading the Zero Carbon Bill or carbon budgets. As a final note, out of left field, I think that education about food in our schools\nshould be made more robust and prominent in the curriculum, with more knowledge provided to students about how their eating\ndecisions may affect their environment, and practical kitchen skills which genuinely empower them to not only have strong control\n\nover how their diet effects their environment, but their health and well-being as well.\n",

  "From my readings the assumption that climate warming is due entirely or mostly to carbon emissions is not sufficiently supported by\n\n the science.

The additional solar energy let into the\n atmosphere because of the thinned ozone layer appears to match quite closely the temperature increases. I am concerned that\n\n most people seem to treat 'climate change' as necessarily due to 'greenhouse gases' and indeed that most people conflate the two\n concepts. Weirdly, ozone is considered a greenhouse gas so the theory suggests we should get rid of the ozone layer. Ridiculous.\n Let's restore the ozone layer to historical quantity before imposing getting too carried away with reducing carbon. Charging people for\n\n carbon emission will be a den of corruption, the money going to unknown profiteers to little good end. There are other good reasons\n for reducing carbon and pollutant emissions but this can be achieved by promoting alternative energy industries.

  "To be really effective you need to take a holistic systems approach. There needs to be more emphasis on eliminating greenhouse\n\ngas generation at source everywhere in the system. Nearly everything that is produced causes GHG generation in its production\nThere need to be the right incentives reduce net GHG emissions everywhere in the system, for producers goods and services more\n\nefficiently with fewer GHG emissions.. Then there is the exponential growth in production, much of it producing ephemeral goods\nwhich are used briefly and then thrown away, depleting resources and generating waste, including GHGs and toxins. Universal\nproduct stewardship and a price on all net GHG emissions – at a price equal to the damage they cause is the only way to really deal\n\nwith climate change. If they cannot afford the price, then the should change their production so that they can. Otherwise the goods\nshould not be produced. Of course this would cause massive disruption if it was introduced immediately, so it would need to be\n\nphased in. This brings me to the third point. Change is urgent because more than half the GHG emissions emitted before global\ntemperature rises above 2ºC have already been emitted, and emissions are still increasing for the reasons above. All emissions now\n\nuse up what is available before 2050, requiring more extreme and disruption if we are to meet the target and prevent unacceptable\ntemperature rise and potentially a positive feedback loop with irreversible effects. The Government needs to work with everybody\nboth here and worldwide to achieve the fundamental changes needed.

Cargo should be sent via rail or cargo\nship and not over expensive roadways (road damage is exponential with the weight of the vehicle - and we used to have a law about\n\nthis very thing.)

  "METHANE The majority of the 16 questions here concern the proposed climate change commission and how far its powers should\n\nextend. This balance is disturbing. The most contentious question refers to the definition of what “zero carbon” actually means.\nEvery option indicates a 'net' emission number, signalling that offsets are acceptable. Two scenarios cover all types of GHG which\n\ninclude methane. Neither allow for the actual reduction of methane. One would allow its growth with offsets, the other would call for\nstabilisation of the methane emissions. The question is devious and this is deeply concerning. Without good knowledge the intent of\nsubmissions here can easily be watered down and/or lost. This looks deliberate. Methane cannot be ignored. It cannot be merely\n\noffset, then carrying on with the current practice of cattle/sheep agriculture at scale. Methane It is HALF the problem in NZ and hence\nHALF the solution must lie here. Methane emissions need to be cut hard and fast, not stabilised at their present levels, and ducking\n\nthis issue will be a disaster for the credibility of the ruling NZ government. As a secondary issue the questions on this topic should\nhave been transparent and not coded so as to apparently side track the issue. The MAIN issue for New Zealand. OPPORTUNITY NZ\n\nshould set an important precedent. New Zealand should become the first country in the world to put a price on agricultural\nemissions, academics and published authors and corporates have already done so, nation states are the laggards. Ethically speaking\n\nNew Zealand can and should lead the way and MUST include ACTUAL REDUCTIONS in agricultural emissions. LACKS AMBITION The\ntarget date of 2050 for attaining this is woefully inadequate given the risks posed. 2035 seems much more impactful and urgent\ntimeline for humanity to act decisively given that we are collectively running the risk for our children of catastrophic climate change…",

  "RECOMMENDATION: Because the proposed name of this bill, namely the Zero Carbon Act, does not clearly or fully describe the\nconcern or the nature of this bill (firstly, nitrous oxide and water vapour are also greenhouse gases but do not contain carbon, and\n\nsecondly, the intent is not to emit zero carbon in greenhouse gases, which would probably be not only impossible but actually lethal\nto all plant life and subsequently all life including human life if achieved), the bill should be renamed the Global Warming and Climate\n\nChange Mitigation and Adaptation Act. If that RECOMMENDATION is not acceptable, at least call it the “Net Zero Carbon Act”.\nRECOMMENDATION: Because of the existential threat of global warming and climate change, the New Zealand Parliament should\nestablish the Zero Carbon Act (or Net Zero Carbon Act, or preferably the Global Warming and Climate Change Mitigation and\n\nAdaptation Act) as ‘entrenched’ legislation requiring at least a 75% majority for amendment or repeal. As well, the Act should prohibit\nthe amendment of the clause expressing the 2050 net zero greenhouse gas emissions target. The vote should be a conscience\n\nvote not subject to political party voting rules and procedures (whipping). This recommendation is intended to reduce significantly\nthe effect of the three-year electoral term with its consequential yo-yoing of political party policy changes. RECOMMENDATION: The\n\nZero Carbon Act (preferably named the Global Warming and Climate Change Mitigation and Adaptation Act), or “the Act”, should\ncontain clauses requiring all other subsequent legislation to comply with the Act so that, after it has become law, it will be one of the\nlegal foundations of our society, like the electoral law and the human rights law.

  "People can't participate usefully in a problem they can't understand. And people don't understand this problem. I've talked to many\n\neducated left leaning environmentalists and rarely found any that understand why and how dairy affects global warming. We should\nhave been teaching this in schools for the last thirty years. Imagine a future where people are incented to understand the problem for\n\ntwo reasons. Firstly, they keep hearing stories and seeing footage of sandy beaches, green pastures, extraordinary kinds of fruit and\nanimals they can't possibly imagine. And they need to know what happened to all of that. Secondly because they live within systems\n\nthat prevent them from using fuels or creating food the way we do now. And they are too hot, or too cold or too hungry. In that future\npeople will understand about CO2 and methane. The atmospheric budget will stand over them and the story of global warming will be\ndeeply entrenched creation mythology. And they will wonder at us and our ignorance. The haze we've allowed ourselves to live in.\n\nThe time we wasted.

I am relieved beyond measure to see this consultation paper and I am grateful to the thousands to\nsacrificed to make it real.

We know they will look back at us in horror because we know they will live in a world where doing what we\ndo is a crime against humanity. I want them to see that, finally, at some point, we got it and we came together and we tried. Finally, I\n\nfear that we may be kidding ourselves with dairy.

  "Climate change signature in New Zealand is not strong to date.

Over a similar period, Christchurch shows zero\nnet average temperature change. Average wind speeds, and number of stormy days has not increased at those locations either. So\nmaybe there is worse to come already loaded in the system with historical global emissions - that might be the case although I\n\nbelieve that the alarmists and doomsayers vastly overstate this threat.

  "I have worked as an agronomist on farms for nearly 30 years. Over his time I have seen a lot of my clients soils improving over time\n\nand building organic matter. Those who use a lot of artificial nitrogen fertiliser or cultivation lose organic matter. Although livestock\nmay emit a lot of methane and nitrous oxide which are greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, if the soil is acting as a carbon sink,\n\nthen this needs to be considered. I have also observed with forestry conversions to pasture, that initially there is very little topsoil the\nfirst year or two, but over time there is a definite topsoil layer being built which is permanent C being held in the soil once it turns\ncertain to humic compounds. Forestry is not the be all and end all, soils which have grown a crop of trees have less soil carbon than\n\nwhat sheep and beef farms will have sequestered over the same time. Trees can act as a carbon sink, but once harvested, the\ncarbon is gone. Soil carbon sequestration is one long term answer to increased CO2 levels and needs to be considered in the big\n\npicture if there is going to be honest science in this whole discussion. Just because Simon Upton excluded soil carbon in the 1990\nKyoto Accord, does not mean it should be excluded in future accords or developments.

All aluminium and\n\nsteel tins must be recycled The supermarkets are more and more pre-wrapping foodstuffs in plastic and this should be discouraged.\nThese actions would be far more beneficial to the environment than the current emphasis on carbon dioxide reduction. If NZ\n\nsucceeds in reducing CO2 emissions our effect on the world will be negligible, on the other hand if we can significantly reduce the\nuse of plastics this country could be a world leader.",
  "Your reports notes \"The costs from climate change are already high and growing.\" So why further penalize New Zealanders (and it will\n\nbe mostly the poorest) to impress offshore unelected bureaucrats ? Why are you turning up the fear? NZ already uses mostly\nrenewable energy, has perhaps the worlds most efficient farming practices and an emissions output so low as to be negligible in\n\nimpact on the atmosphere. (and don't quote per-capita emissions output - those figures are a fiction- only total emissions count IF\nyou are serious about solving this over hyped issue - working on a per-captia basis suggests the issue is not at all pressing)\n\nFortunately, the modeled impacts of \"Climate Change\" are vastly over-hyped - and we do have far more pressing issues to deal with in\nNZ right now. The Government should instead commit the billions that will be wasted in Climate Mitigation & Zero Carbon Target\n\nadministration to NZ' s Children's health, safety and education. All we have to do to combat Climate Change is take off the jersey and\nwalk inland slowly.\n",
  "I thought that there was supposed to a DISCUSSION, but in fact we are required to accept the Minister is correct - CO2 Emissions are\nthe cause of all our problems - and only discuss how far are we prepared to go to restrict its release to atmosphere. I think the\n\ndiscussion needs to start a few steps earlier before we start to close down our economy!!!!!. I also think that all citizens need be\ngiven real data, not subjective ideology and alarmist statements, so that they are able to endorse or discard the shrinking of our\n\neconomy by way of binding referendum. At the very least, they need to have a clear picture of what life in our country will look like with\nthe withdrawal hydrocarbons [the most cost efficient and concentrated source of energy currently available to humanity], and a clear\n\nplan on how this energy source will be replaced given that: 1. wind and solar energy require more energy and resources to\nmanufacture than they are able to generate [ask Germany and Scandinavia who have said that these scources cannot replace\nhydrocarbons]; 2. Nuclear energy is currently denied to New Zealanders by current legislation; and 3. Hydro energy resources are all-\n\nbut at maximum capacity. How any Government could deliberately commit its population to a reducing standard of living is difficult to\ncomprehend. It is time to STOP treating CO2 as a pollutant - it is not. ASK ANY PLANT!",
  "I Support the direction of this Bill.",
  "The discussion document focuses quite heavily on the effect of the proposed emissions targets on GDP. It should be recognised\n\nthat GDP is only one very selective measure. Slower GDP growth isn't inherently a bad thing (in fact, it can be a good thing if it means\nreducing the economy's burden on Earth's finite resources while maintaining an acceptable level of equality and wellbeing for all\n\npeople). It would be good to focus on the effect of emissions targets on a basket of measures summarising the wellbeing of people\nand the environment, and not only economic growth.",

  "Allowing Governments to attack Agricultural sectors will seriously affect everybody in NZ in a very negative way (i.e. most people will\n\nbe unemployed, there won't be new jobs to go into, higher taxes, less income, everything will be more expensive to buy as NZ will\nneed to buy food in, instead of being a quality exporter that brings in money for our country), especially for something that is purely\n\nbased on assumptions. Are we really going to plant trees over 10% of quality, versatile farmland that produces renewable pasture at\nleast 4 times per year and through photosynthesis turns carbon dioxide into oxygen a lot quicker and more often than trees. Trees\ntakes 30 years to grow, don't need a lot of care, strips the nutrients from the soil and it would take a good 5 years to rejuvenate the\n\nsoil after the trees have been felled and stumps have been removed etc. The billion dollars worth seems to be only for planting trees\nand paying bums on seats with fancy job titles, not what is needed to help our country to produce enough food for our people (all\n\nNZers) and be exported to other countries, which brings in money for our country to help us live better lives. Our Government is\nwasting our time, money and messing with our livelihoods at our expense. Fellow NZers do you really think that our Government\n\nmembers are going to put their hands in their own pockets to put a large percentage of their paycheques into these assumptions?\nWhy should we?",
  "Climate change will require wider spheres of management than just emissions reductions.",
  "Thank you for being a Government who is finally displaying a genuine interest in acting decisively on climate change. Now it is\nabsolutely that you do not allow the process to be derailed by vested interests, or by people who say it's \"too ambitious\" to legislate\nfor net zero emissions of ALL greenhouse gases. Yes, it will be challenging, and yes, we need to be extremely careful to 'off-set' the\n\nregressive nature of the impacts that both climate change policy and climate change itself will have on vulnerable populations and\ncertain sectors. However, supporters of net zero emissions of all GHGs are not calling for an ambitious target because we don't care\n\nthat it means significant changes for the country (and especially for vulnerable communities; farmers; those currently employed by\nhigh-emitting industries etc)- it is because the evidence is overwhelming that we can't NOT be ambitious- time is running out to take\naction which a) can be well-planned to try and minimise shocks and b) avoids breaching critical ecological tipping points that will\n\ncause catastrophic climate change. Climate change is not waiting for us- if we don't act now, the impacts of climate change will not\nsimply dissappear- they will simply escalate. And those impacts will still disproportionally hurt those same vulnerable communities,\n\nfarmers etc - except far more so. It's tough to get people on board with the 'sacrifice a little now to save a lot later' mentality, but we\nmust push on- and again, find ways to minimise the negative impacts that will arise from taking action- this should be a critical focus\n\nof the Commission. We must also try to 'exploit' the numerous possible opportunities that climate action may have (technological\ndevelopments, a return to a more holistic way of living that is sustainable for this Earth, health and equity co-benefits... etc). The\nCommission, too, should factor co-benefits of action into its considerations, and seek to give advice on which policies will most likely\n\nproduce co-benefits and emission reductions at the same time. The Government, in 'selling' this Bill to the public, must try and be as\npositive and as hopeful as possible, without being naive or glossing over the very real fears people have and challenges we face.\n\nPeople firstly need their fears to be genuinely heard and listened to; then, they need hope, solutions, and a sense of self-efficacy\n(see: O'Neill and Nicholson-Cole, 2009 ' \"Fear Won't Do It”: Promoting Positive Engagement With Climate Change...). I hope this is\n\nsomething that can be incorporated into the conversation that surrounds this process moving forward. Thank you for your time.",
  "I trust in the Government, and I hope that through the Carbon Bill we set robust and strong targets that will get us to net zero carbon\nby 2050. For our future and the future of generations to come, now is the time to act and make impactful changes for the betterment\nof our people and our environment.\n",
  "It shouldn't be the Government to tackle this issue, whenever the government tries to change human behaviour it always backfires. It\n\nshould be left to innovative businesses and technology which overtime will reduce emissions. Also more study should be done to\nsee if human made emission are causing a adverse effects.

Short term costs will give long term advantage in to the future. I am a Nurse and am dismayed at the\nshort term view , and token gestures that hospitals take towards waste reduction. An example of this immoral approach to global\n\nresources : single use stainless steel scissors and forceps which are imported from third world ? India, used once, then discarded. In\nthe past hospitals have had larger sterilisation services and good quality scissors etc have been autoclaved and reused. The\neconomics of this situation is immoral and happens in many areas of business- and points to reasons why we are in our current\n\nenvironmental predicament",

  "A just transition means that a monetary system for allocating emmissions to the rich based on their ability to pay is unjust. Just as rich\n\ncant litter more than a poor person, nor should they be able to emit more as an individual. Therefore rationing systems rather than\nauction systems should be put in place. Consideration should be given to the fact that it is the rich who have put the existing CO2 up\n\nthere in the atmosphere. It is clearly unjust that the poor equally pay to remove the CO2, and that the rich do not pay for the damage\nALREADY caused. We need to use our trading relationships to penalise or stop trade with countries which are not part of the Paris\n\nagreement or are making no progress on reducing emmissions.",

I want New Zealand to be a leader on the international stage with regards to our approach. We can inspire other countries,\n\nbe on the right side of history, and transform our economy to be more intelligent and sustainable. My training in engineering makes it\nclear to me that risks from climate change are real, present and extremely expensive - strong action to prevent climate change and\n\nmitigate its effects are the most environmentally and economically sound response to this massive challenge. Physics does not care\nwhat the ideology of a particular government is, and a strong response to climate change should not be a political issue. I am one\n\nyear away from qualifying as a doctor. We know that the effects of climate change on health are going to be increasingly dramatic, with\nnew diseases and natural disasters causing morbidity and mortality in ways that are currently unknown to New Zealanders. Vulnerable\n\npopulations are particularly at risk and thus mitigating climate change is an important part of health equity in an already very unequally\nhealthy society. Finally, I am desperate for my two young children to inherit a society, economy, and world that is smart, sustainable,\nsafe, and equitable. I often speak to them about how we elect our leaders to make brave decisions that help us make our societies\n\nbetter, and I call on you to show true leadership and commit to ambitious, binding targets that we can be proud of.

  "Submission for the Zero Carbon Act Starting with the low hanging fruit is a good way to make rapid progress towards the Zero Carbon\nGoal. Much carbon entering the atmosphere as CO2 comes from fossil fuels used by petrol and diesel fueled vehicles for transport\n\nservices in our economy. But now, with the arrival of electric vehicles that are already practical substitutes for transport of all types, a\ntransition which has already started, can be accelerated by such a Zero Carbon Act and so will dramatically reduce fossil carbon\n\nentering our atmosphere. I would like to suggest that a complete transition to an all-electric economy could be achieved in say ten\nyears with appropriate Government Aid and Encouragement. Should such a transition be successful, other ongoing benefits to our\nsociety would be the elimination of N20, a long-lived greenhouse gas from exhaust pipes, along with smoke and other PM 2.5\n\nparticles believed to be causing the ill health and early deaths of the public at large. Indeed, there would be no exhaust pipes and\nNZ’s contribution to global warming would be greatly and rapidly reduced. The need for speedy action can be seen all around the\n\nworld, not just in NZ. The trajectory of global temperature curves, CO2 and Methane concentrations, all are accelerating upwards, an\nice-free Arctic is a real possibility even next Arctic Summer, and Antarctic ice is dwindling. Greenland is losing ice and sea level rise is\n\nincreasing. Why would we wait to act? In the background the very real possibility of positive feed backs such as where warming\ndestabilises massive stores of Arctic methane clathrates to release methane, which in turn reinforces the warming rate to release yet\n\nmore methane in an accelerating self-perpetuating reaction. There is the potential for very rapid and massive increases in the current\nwarming being seen. A further benefit that would accrue from a rapid transition to all- electric transport comes from the fact that if\nSolar Energy is used to replace the energy formally supplied by burning fossil fuels for transport purposes, then the costs of that\n\nenergy and quantity of that energy is significantly less than the costs of those previously used fuels. Here it is assumed that solar\nenergy would be generated in a distributed manner wherever that energy is being used to charge electric vehicles, usually in garages\n\nattached to domestic dwellings or business enterprises. ( See Vector for the feasibility of using Distributed Generators without\ncausing grid disruption). This leads to an estimate on a per household level of benefit from not buying petrol and diesel of $2,951 and\n\n$5,348 per annum respectively. Once installed and paid for the solar panels will continue to deliver power for up to at least 30 years.\nPayback times are 2.58 years and 5.32 years respectively. In total an additional 48 Billion dollars would circulate in our economy\nannually, and this figure does not include the costs of ill health and early death, and accelerating climate change avoided. I would like\n\nto share the spreadsheet that I created for interested parties to understand how the benefits mentioned above were calculated. Of\ncourse, the results depend on current costs and prices that can change in the future, but these are inputs that can be changed on\n\nthe spreadsheet at any time to reveal new results. I was unsuccessful in attaching a copy to the first submission I attempted, so will\nsend a working copy to anybody making a request by email to me at",

In addition they presume the right to the space of many cyclists or pedestrians. Worst vehicles presume they\nhave paid for a road corridor they can use for their exclusive safety, reluctant to truly share the corridor they have never paid for (they\n\nonly share part of the pavement costs with rate and tax payers). Until we start pricing for weight and space (congestion) so electric\nbikes, quadcycles and active transport have a true cost advantage, we will never get a rational efficient transport system. This will\n\ncontinue to distort our development with millions of tonnes of concrete and construction poured into unserviceable locations.\nSavings in emissions could be made from changing from white flight tribal education with 40% of peak hour traffic being children\ndriven to school at the cost of their health, development and safety of other children using active transport.

Yes, we have high emissions from agriculture, but this provides\n\na unique opportunity to develop emission reduction technology and expertise that we can export around the world. Moreover, there\nis clear evidence that industrial scale agriculture has adversely impacted our natural environment and tarnished our clean, green\nimage.

  "I co-chair the Lancet Commission on Obesity which defines The Global Syndemic of obesity, under nutrition and climate change as\nthe biggest current and future threat to health. A syndemic is a synergy of epidemics which interact and have common societal\n\ncauses. There are many common drivers between climate change and obesity which need to be recognised. Both are mediated by\nhuman overconsumption which in turn is driven by consumptogenic environments ie the easy and default choices and even desired\n\nchoices (for GDP growth) are to over-consume. The Commission MUST have a deep view of the fundamental drivers of over\nconsumption and recommend and monitor policies and actions. Deep actions include: preventing powerful vested commercial\n\ninterests from influencing policy development; circular economy systems which internalise externalities; systems analyses of the\nproblems with systemic solutions; powerful accountability systems to hold actors to account (government, industry, consumers);\nalleviation of poverty etc. the full report of the Lancet Commission will be available in early 2019.",

I am also concerned that international trade agreements may also slow down\nprogress. It is important that the positive opportunities that arise from addressing climate change and the moral obligation to do so\n\nare highlighted. If we delay action it will be far more expensive and we will be less likely to succeed.

  "We have committed would being emissions free by 2050 and I commend the courage to do this (bearing in mind the science shows\nus that this will only leave us with an outside chance of reaching 2 degrees). To be emissions free we are looking at about 10%\n\nreductions per year. Has the magnitude of this task been mapped out in terms of carbon budgets for each individual in New Zealand?\nStarting from next year, people need to be emissions free for 1 month a year; this means no flying, driving or creating emissions from\nfood, power, water, heating. Do people realise this? I think the government needs to be honest with the public, 10% reductions per\n\nyear are probably not compatible with a growing economy This issue is something we have not historically had to deal with on a\nglobal scale. It is unprecedented and therefore requires unprecedented policy making. Government needs to set the course and be\n\nhonest with the public about the situation. We are facing an enormous challenge - greater than any generation in history. Perhaps it is\nprudent for the act to include penalties for politicians and leaders who do not act. Scientist attest to dire consequences if politicians\n\ndo not take drastic steps. This means MAJOR changes as a society in the next decade.",
  "As a psychologist, I am very interested in the secondary benefits of reducing emissions. Having lived overseas and moved back to NZ\n\n5 years ago, I have been very aware of how the car-centric society of NZ (particularly Auckland where I live) reduces the sense of\ncommunity and social connectedness, making it harder to meet one's neighbours, compared to places where people predominantly\n\nwalk, cycle or catch public transport. This negatively impacts people's mental health, sense of belonging and safety in their\ncommunity. With two small children, I would love to cycle to our local shops (which are too far to walk for preschoolers) but Auckland's\n\nlack of safe cycle infrastructure mean that I feel unsafe to do so. Cycling is wonderful for one's physical and mental health. It is crucial\nthat this legislation is ambitious and leads to action, not just more talk. NZ was once a progressive country. We can be that again.",

  "I fully support the ideas presented in the Zero Carbon Bill. I think that there needs to be a clear pathway not only for government but\nfor businesses, landowners and individuals on how they can reduce emissions and help sequester carbon. This could be through a\n\ncombination of education, incentives (eg reduction in insurance premium, govt payment) and deterrents (eg fines, increase in\ninsurance premium for not mitigating against climate change). There are many policies listed for reducing emissions as well as the\n\npolicy for planting 1billion trees to actually sequester the carbon. I think that there needs to be more done to sequester carbon. I\nbelieve that land owners/farmers hold a huge responsibility here as far as this goes. They are the guardians of our soils. Relatively\n\nsmall increases in soil organic matter amount to billions of tons of carbon stored. Any increase in soil organic matter and improvement\nin soil structure also greatly increases the rate of water infiltration and retention in soil. This helps minimize the frequency and severity\nof floods and droughts caused by land degradation. There should be education/policies for farmers on proper land management\n\npractices (eg never leaving bare soil (this can be done by planting crops into pasture), reduce amount of sprays, intensive grazing\nwith long rest times so that pasture can develop proper root systems etc). and should be rewarded as such for carbon that they\n\nsequester, as well as punishments for bad land management. I think farmers should be given help to carry out these things because\nit is such a vital role that they play. They can be part of the solution and not the problem. The benefits far out way the disadvantages:\n\nbetter water & pasture quality, less expenses, same carrying capacity etc. If you need any references regarding this information,\nplease let me know.",
  "Any further farm conversions to dairying should be disallowed and support given to farmers willing to revert to cropping or sheep\nfarming. Water for irrigation should come at a premium. There should be encouragement and support given to businesses finding\nnew uses for wool - a great example is Allbirds (shoes). Attention needs to be given to educating the public on the consequences of\n\nclimate change, the astromonical price of inaction, as well as the inevitable cost of action. Sacrifices will be required and, in a world\nwhere progress seems to be measured in only material terms, many will find this a bitter pill to swallow unless they fully understand\n\nthe alternative. Forestry is obviously a huge priority but if it's to consist mostly of pines there would need to be some provision made\nfor dealing with wilding seedlings making their unwelcome presence known in areas of native bush or scenic value like the McKenzie\n\nBasin.

  "I'm very disappointed that there is no reference to Soil Carbon in this paper. While Carbon emissions from soil pale beside fossil fuel\nemissions they are a significant contributor, with estimates ranging from 40-500 billion tons of carbon lost during the industrial\n\nrevolution period. The loss of soil carbon also contributes to water pollution, loss of nutrient and water holding capacity of soils,\n(Reduced yields and increased droughts.) and increases flood damage during heavy rain events. (Again through a lack of water\n\nholding capacity.) The science is strong that the following factors cause loss of soil carbon. 1. Cultivation and erosion. 2. Overgrazing.\n3. Loss of fertility. 4. Forestation. 5. Over application of synthetic nitrogen fertiliser. The exciting thing about soil carbon is that by good\nmanagement it can easily be increased and governments around the world are recognising this. This increase can be easily\n\nmeasured and a robust measuring system down to a metre's depth has been successfully developed in New Zealand by Peter Floyd.\nNo country is better placed to increase soil carbon than New Zealand because of our extensive pastoral grazing land, and proper\n\nmanagement of this soil carbon will easily enable us to meet a zero net carbon emission target well ahead of the targets set out in\nthis bill. To achieve this we need a government that takes Climate Change and the Environment seriously, we need individual farmers\n\nto be incentivised to increase their soil carbon by access to carbon credits for soil carbon, and we need a robust measuring system\nsuch as Peter Floyd has developed to be adopted as a national standard for recognition of soil carbon at an individual farm level.",

It is partially an addiction to them, but also developing nations like China and\n\nIndia need substantial help getting off carbon. The rest of the world needs to remain united on climate change with or without the\nUnited States. That will mean in particular developing a framework that looks acceptable to China and India using a mix of incentives\n\nsuch as offers of help developing sustainable forestry, scrubber technology in chimneys for factories that catch the carbon\ncomponents instead of releasing them. Whilst newer cars are cleaner in terms of emissions and more efficient in terms of fuel\n\nconsumption, some basic facts are ignored. For many New Zealanders they are simply too expensive. Also many New Zealanders do\nnot have a use for stylized vehicles, especially when their existing ones are working fine - a Toyota Surf, well maintained can last 20\nyears or longer and have 500,000km on the clock. Thus you have a large number of Toyota Surf's, older model Holden Commodores,\n\nFord Falcons, Subaru Legacy's still on the road.

  "• Despite NZ being a small country and having a very small impact on total global GHG emissions, we should still participate in\n\nreducing emissions and playing our part internationally. Possibly our strongest contribution could be demonstrating a how a country\ncan transition to a carbon neutral economy • Support the establishment of a climate commission • Climate change commission\n\nshould be a decision making group to take our response to climate change out of the political arena. • New Zealand’s economy by\n2050 should be shaped by economic activity that has an emissions profile that reflects New Zealand’s equitable contribution on a\n\nworld wide scale, to fit within a 2 degree change. Any climate change policy should seek to achieve this. • Any economic\nincentives/penalties should reflect the cost/benefit of the changed activity and be designed to shift NZ’s economy to fully account for\n\nthe effect of GHG emissions. • Support the concept of treating short lived gases (methane from ruminants) differently from long lived\nGHG, as long the global temperature increase is below agreed international targets. If global temperatures are less than 2 degrees\nthen stabilising methane emissions (to reduce further temperature increases) is sufficient. However as we get closer to the 2 degree\n\nthreshold then the size of temperature increase contributed by methane emissions needs to decrease and this may mean that the\nshort term GHG emissions that is emitted from our agriculture sector needs to decrease as we get closer to the 2 degree threshold.\n\n• In the interim (while below the 2 degree threshold) the amount of short lived GHG that a farmer can emit should be linked to area of\nthe farm. It should be net emissions after taking account of any sequestration taking place on the farm. • Support idea of emission\n\nbudgets. This set short term targets and allows monitoring progress against them. • 2050 target should be able to be changed if\ncircumstances change.",
  "Forestry plantings are not without issue as seen by the devastation caused by heavy rainfall in the Tasman and Gisborne areas that\nwere recently logged. Sheep and beef farms cover diverse landscapes, with numerous trees scattered across them. Many of these\n\ntrees – whether they are shelterbelts, riparian plantings, erosion management plantings or blocks of native vegetation – are not\ncounted in the Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS). Need to quantify the total carbon sink on sheep and beef farms (both inside and out\nof the ETS) Nearly half of all QEII National Trust covenants are found on sheep and beef farms (47%) and the area of sheep and beef\n\nland protected under QEII, Ngā Whenua Rāhui and other covenants is growing but not included in the ETS. The contribution of\ncarbon sequestration made by pasture and soils needs to be included in determining net carbon emissions on pastoral farming\n\nsystems.

There is\nalready substantial potential for wood to energy from our existing plantation estate and this should be acknowledged.

  "1. Climate change is one of the biggest challenges facing people in poverty here and in developing countries. We can’t ignore the\nimpact climate change is having on our neighbours in the Pacific and across the developing world. 2. Climate Change is a global\n\nproblem – it cannot be tackled by countries in isolation. New Zealand must demonstrate global leadership and match its bold\ndomestic emissions reduction agenda: by having an equally ambitious climate change strategy abroad. 3. Access to climate finance\nis a matter of climate justice – those who have contributed least to the causes of climate change are typically the most vulnerable to\n\nits impacts and have the least resources to respond. 4. We must take responsibility for our global emissions and the climate impacts\nthat we have contributed to. It’s very important that all New Zealanders have their say on how we make the shift to a zero carbon\n\nfuture here in New Zealand but we must also help the world’s most vulnerable communities across the Pacific adjust to the impacts\non climate change. 5. We must ensure that the Zero Carbon Bill is transparent. This means the bill must include a requirement to\n\nproduce annual reports about New Zealand’s international climate change contributions in order to ensure that the Pacific countries\nget the support they need and can plan to adapt to their changing environment. 6.Transparency in the Bill will promote public\n\nengagement and political accountability. New Zealanders will be able to understand the international contributions we are making and\nas a nation, we will be able to stand tall that we are supporting our Pacific neighbours adapt to their climate change reality. 7. It is time\nfor New Zealand to lead again. We have a history of global leadership: we were the first country to give women the vote and the first\n\nto become nuclear free. It is time to take another giant step towards climate justice globally. 8. New Zealand has demonstrated global\nleadership with our commitment to stopping oil and gas exploration – now let us continue that moral leadership and include\n\ntransparency in what and how we support climate change efforts abroad. 9.

  "I'm excited to be submitting on the Zero Carbon Bill as I am a long-time conservationist, environmentalist and supporter of Green\n\nparties, in Australia as well as New Zealand. My submission therefore entirely supports the introduction of this bill. Congratulations to\nthe coalition government for this and all the fantastic changes you are making in New Zealand. New Zealand may be a small country,\n\nwith a small population and a small proportion of the world's greenhouse gas emissions but it is respected internationally, and other\nnations will be inspired by our actions to tackle climate change - it is great to lead the way, and the certainty that this bill will give to\n\nindustry will drive a new clean, efficient economy, that will finally show the world how we can live sustainably on this planet, to provide\ninter-generational equity, which just makes sense - no more greed! The Commission needs to include experts on the natural world\nand it's protection for its own sake, accounting for the environmental services that it provides ($ value). This would also encompass\n\nhow we can help nature (species, ecosystems, etc.) adapt to climate change. The Commission's expert on agriculture would need to\npropose examination of sheep and dairy farming and the conversion of such land to forest growing for carbon sequestration,\n\nincluding government sponsorship for conversion. This is probably too specific for this submission but regarding transport in, out of\nand around NZ, of people and goods - alternatives to air transport, such as modern large sailing craft or the use of biofuels must be\n\ninvestigated. I believe that The Zero Carbon Act should also provide a framework for the help we give our neighbouring countries\n(principally the Pasifika region) facing climate change including transparency in international climate finance. For our Pasifika\n\nneighbours, NZ must support them with their specific problems and the actions to fix them whether financial, on-the-ground work or\ntechnology for adaptation or halting climate change, or assistance in creating appropriate legislation or strategies/planning.

  "Solar scientists are claiming that due to the current 11 year low solar cycle 24 and even lower solar cycle 25 forecast we are heading\n for a freezing period of possibly some 30 to 50 years ahead. With current global satellite temperatures being similar to those of a\n dozen and more years ago, it appears the Solar Scientists are correct and you are planning for warming when you should be planning\n\n for cooling temperatures in the years ahead. I have just checked the ice extent graphs for the Arctic and the Antarctic and both show\n increased ice extent this year. Global temperatures over the last years since the recent El Nino are showing a rapid decline even\n though carbon fuel use is increasing worldwide. Carbon dioxide is a vital gas at only 0.04 % of the atmosphere by volume that plants\n\n need and thrive on. The amount man produces is even less at 0.0004%. That is such a tiny amount it can be hard to imagine so I\n have made a calculation..... If the earths atmosphere is represented by a sheet of A4 paper, then mans contribution of CO2 is\n represented by a tiny full stop. Yet that miniscule dot of CO2 is supposed to be Earths climate control knob ??? You need to seriously\n\n consider that those Solar Scientists are correct and planning needs to be made now for a cooling period ahead with all the problems\n that will bring for various power production, power transmission and outages, housing warmth, difficulties with food production and\n shorter growing periods, transport and vehicle fuel supplies.",

  "The Zero Carbon Bill does not consider, recognise or encourage any carbon capture methods other than growing trees. This is very\nshort-sighted and limiting what is possible to achieve.

No consideration is given to influencing consumption behaviour (other than carbon pricing) when\nalternatives exist. Why do we fail to learn from watching what works or fails in other countries?, Successful consumption levers include\ne.g. tax the use of cars with engines >2 litres as they do in northern Europe and that changes behaviour and reduces consumption\n\ndramatically. Encourage electric car uptake by using tax incentives (such as no GST) or rebates and subsidising electricity (works in\nCalifornia and Norway). New Zealand has very expensive electricity at the domestic consumer level and something needs to done to\n\nbring this into line with other OECD countries, i.e. bring it down so we can afford to use electricity to replace wood/biomass, coal, oil\nand gas where possible.

  "I have been writing on zero emissions on my blog for some years. Below I submit the URL's with a short comment for each one. As I\n\nsaid above, the government sometimes actually has to do things itself but at it's best, it sets the playing field; the rules, so that we do\nthe necessary. These article are very much predicated on this principle. 1) Demand Balancing of our electrical grid Traditionally power\n\ncompanies have operated by supply balancing; bringing on new generation as the demand increases. Power companies must be\nencouraged to use demand balancing; opening up new demand as base demand decreases. The best incentive for this is price but\n\nthe infrastructure must be in place so that you can automatically turn on various devices (such as car charging) as the price\ndecreases. http://mtkass.blogspot.com/2018/04/electrical-demand-balancing.html 2) Election financing The one ring that controls\nthem all is election financing. Who Pays the Piper Calls the Tune was never so true as with election financing. Vested interest\n\nfinancing of political parties must cease completely. Otherwise we will never reach our goals of zero carbon.\nhttp://mtkass.blogspot.com/2018/01/wasted-effort.html 3) Sorting Out Dairy Farms This doesn't mean reducing our dairy herd.\n\nDairying could become the darlings of the green movement. The devil is in the detail.\nhttp://mtkass.blogspot.com/2018/01/mitigating-harm-dairy-causes-to.html 4) Sorting Out Farming For most of our (human) history we\n\nhave released carbon into the atmosphere from our soils adding to atmospheric Carbon Dioxide. This carbon could be returned to\nthe soil by correct farming while at the same tome markedly improving the bottom line of the farmers both in individual crop\nproduction and reliability of crops. http://mtkass.blogspot.com/2018/01/conservation-agriculture.html 5) Our History Here is a book\n\nreview of the history of Humans destroying their soils and in doing so releasing carbon into the atmosphere. Here in New Zealand we\nare continuing this destructive tradition. http://mtkass.blogspot.com/2017/11/dirt.html 6)Composting Barns Composting barns\n\nensure that any gas that goes off manure goes off as Carbon dioxide rather than as methane. Methane is a far more potent green\nhouse gas than Carbon dioxide. There are many other benefits to the farmer. http://mtkass.blogspot.com/2017/10/composting-\n\nbarns.html 7)This is the Blockbuster David Montgomery has traveled all over the world observing farmers who have come up,\nindependently of each other, of a new/old way of farming. If adopted widely, a great deal of the carbon we have vented into the\n\natmosphere would be incorporated into the soil. This is a book review of one of his books. 8) The Ratchet Effect One of the doges\nthe power companies use to disadvantage the small solar power owner is what I call the Ratched Effect. If you want increased solar\ninstallation by private households, this must not be allowed. http://mtkass.blogspot.com/2013/10/solar-power-and-ratchet.html\n\n9)Making the Installation of Solar Electric Economically Feasible http://mtkass.blogspot.com/2013/06/net-metering.html 10) Another\none for Making Solar Electric Worthwhile http://mtkass.blogspot.com/2013/04/solar-electric-whats-missing.html 11) Charcoal Char\n\ncan be incorporated into the soil. It has no contained nutrients itself but fulfils a number of important functions in the soil besides\nsequestering carbon for a very long period (charcoal is refractory). If plantation wood was built into long lasting structures and the\n\nwaste charred and put in our soils, we would be sequestering considerable carbon from the atmosphere.\nhttp://mtkass.blogspot.com/2010/11/biochar.html 12) Mining Royalties and carbon reduction/sequestration Mining is a 'one-off'\nWhen it is done it is done and won't come again. There is no justification for using the revenue from mining (coal, gold, iron etc etc)\n\nfor current consumption. It should be put into investments for the long term. The best of these would be to encourage carbon\nreduction and sequestration for the future of our descendents. http://mtkass.blogspot.com/2010/10/mining-royalties-and-\n\nrenewable-energy.html 13) Other Benefits There are so many other benefits to taking the various measures that would address\nclimate change (zero carbon) that we could almost ignore climate change and take these measure just for their other benefits.\n\nhttp://mtkass.blogspot.com/2010/10/forget-climate-change.html 14) Wind Farms Wind farms have got a bad rap in some quarters.\nMuch of this is Nimbi'ism but some may be justified. The government should work our (research) which is which to a) put the\n\nnimbi'ism in it's place and if any concerns are justified, address them. http://mtkass.blogspot.com/2010/07/enabling-wind-farms.html\n15) Electric Cars Clearly, our main source of carbon emissions is our fleet and the domestic fleet is most easily addressed. This blog\ngives the benefits of increasing the uptake of electric cars and the ways it can be achieved.\n\nhttp://mtkass.blogspot.com/2010/07/electric-cars-in-new-zealand-uptake-of.html 16) Jim Hansen Jim Hansen has proposed a way of\nreducing carbon emissions. It is at the heart of the problem. It would compensate the public for any extra expense during the\n\ntransition (Actually the benefits both during and after the conversion to renewables are immense) Show courage and adopt his\nsuggestion. http://mtkass.blogspot.com/2009/12/jim-hansens-climate-change-solution.html 17) Legislation for Electric Cars Actually\n\nthis applies far beyond just electric cars. Government is at the best when it sets the scene and lets us get on with doing the\nnecessary. http://mtkass.blogspot.com/2009/11/legislation-for-electric-cars.html",
  "Even though it seems clear that the UN and the IPCC believe they have an understanding of the future of the planets climate the\nscience is not settled. As an MSc in Earth Science and now 28 years of reading and understanding of the sciences behind how our\n\nplanet works I am deeply troubled that we are rushing into policy without a reasonable certainty of the science. The precautionary\nprinciple is usually used when there is no real risk of negative affect and in this legislation there is massive risk to our most vulnerable\n\npopulation. There is no harm in waiting for a year or two to at least have a better understanding of what the future holds. There are\nmany examples in the literature and in the data, for instance, that show no risk of sealevel reaching even the range of heights\nmentioned in the report within 100 years (NZ data used). Nor is there any evidence that substantiates the increase in extreme\n\nweather events beyond normal background events. I note there is no obvious way to verbally submit on this bill but I am happy to\npresent to the Ministry at any time required post submission date data that shows the hypothesis \"Increasing Human caused CO2 in\n\nthe atmosphere will cause accelerated sea level rise, increased severity and frequency of extreme weather, acidification of the worlds\noceans or catastrophic melting of the polar ice caps\" has already failed and that we may well be embarking on a fools errand.

  "I want to reiterate my total opposition to the E.T.S. The governments review of the scheme in 2016 found that it had had no\nsignificant effect in reducing emissions. Other countries have had similar problems. I favour a carbon tax which is initially set at the\n\ncurrent market level of ETS credits. It should automatically increase by 5% cumulatively each year so that polluters can see from the\noutset that reducing emissions is the only acceptable way of staying in business. Credits could be used to pay the tax during the first\n\n5 years but would stay at the 2018 market price, so that they would steadily become less valuable in paying the tax. We must keep as\na top priority, the need to stop further global warming and also work towards reversing warming that has already taken place so that\nwe can return to temperatures as at mid 20th century & around 350 ppm of CO2 or less in the atmosphere. I suggest two measures\n\nwhich will help achieve a zero carbon economy: 1) Legislate to stop the sales of new internal combustion engines by 2040 or earlier.\nIf this is done now then individuals and businesses will get a clear message that fossil fuel use is on the way out. Transport\n\ncontributes 19% of NZ CO2 emissions plus some N2O emissions so will have to be cut some time anyway. 2) Legislate that all new\nbuildings must be energy self sufficient. This will have a dual effect of taking the strain off energy providers as electric vehicles make\n\nmore demands on the system, and also provide for charging EV's at home and work without using grid power. The other advantage\nwould be to make buildings more resilient after earthquakes or other natural disasters.",

  "WE NEED TO FACE THE FACTS THAT: (1) Climate change mechanisms were well enough understood by scientists in the early 1980's\nto correctly initiate the Kyoto Protocol; (2) Right wing climate change denialism has been spectacularly effective in blocking the\n\nnecessary emissions reductions from being implemented and as a result emissions have increased since the 1991 Kyoto Protocol\nwas agreed; (3) Irresponsible political management of the climate change issue and delayed action has substantially increased the\n\nrisks to humanity of catastrophic climate change impacts occurring; (4) Temperature changes associated with the Earth's energy\nimbalance have been absorbed by the oceans and ice melt but will start to increase more rapidly as the oceans warm. There is a\n\nmaterial risk that climate change impacts will massively impact agricultural output leading to famine. Crop-growing and grazing land is\na delicate and very thin layer [only 50 cm thick] of the the ecosystem that is extremely vulnerable to minor climate change damage (\neg flooding, erosion, temperature change and drought ); (5) There is a real risk of sea level rises being dramatically larger or more\n\nrapid (or both) than the \"1-2 metres in the next 100 years\" planning guidelines communicated by the NZ Government which are\nintellectually dishonest in that they fail to state the true scale of sea level rises that could occur; (6) There is credible geological\n\nevidence showing historical sea level rises of around 10 metres being associated with only a 1.0 degree C rise in atmospheric\ntemperatures. The Paris Accord only aims to limit temperature increase to 2.0 degrees C (maybe 1.5 degrees C). The associated\n\nscale of sea level rise will result in massive destruction of valuable human-built infrastructure and significant inundation of low altitude\nagricultural land. It is very likely that the Paris Accord targets are too soft. (7) The maximum potential for sea level rises of around 70\nmetres from ice melt would be enormously destructive to human society and economies as would sea level rises of only 10-20\n\nmetres; (8) Modern advanced societies depend on stability and the long term use of assets. New Zealand will never rationally be able\nafford to rebuild Whangarei, Auckland, Tauranga, Hamilton, Palmerston North, Wellington, Christchurch, Dunedin, and Invercargill as a\n\nresult of sea level rise and inundation. Prevention will be cheaper than dealing with the consequences of climate change; (9) There is\ncredible scientific evidence for the existence of feedback processes that could swamp any ability for humanity to 'control' climate\n\nchange by emissions reductions and this should drive far greater urgency in our actions than has been evidence to date; AND\nTHEREFORE WE MUST ensure that New Zealand's climate change response truly reflects the real gravity of the climate change\nproblem. While we are a small country, leadership is a critical element of driving global progress. We must lead given the lack of global\n\nprogress. Finally, I strongly recommend that we consider the benefits of 'central bank funding mechanisms' that will enable rapid\nprogress to be made on critical projects ( eg wind farms, geothermal power stations, railway electrification, energy system upgrades,\n\npublic transport upgrades, research and development initiatives etc ) whilst allowing for the costs to be amortised across multiple\ngenerations. The use of 'quantitative easing' has precedents globally to rescue the banking system. Saving the planet from human-\n\ninduced climate change is a far more worthy goal and will result in the sort of stability that financial markets, businesses and ordinary\npeople undeniably prefer.",

I also support taking a science-based approach to ensure our efforts to\n\nreduce emissions are as impactful as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases, while reducing short-lived gases\nto sustainable levels. This target should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using international carbon credits. At\nthe moment we are borrowing from the future of upcoming generations.

The UK's Zero Carbon Act\nhas been very effective in enabling the long term planning that is required to transition to a low carbon economy and I believe that a\nsimilar Zero Carbon Act is New Zealand's best hope to set and reach 2050 targets that are fully compatible with the Paris\n\nAgreement's 1.5°C limit on global warming. At a small scale my household has already taken many steps to reduce our carbon\nfootprint- we have shifted to be near a public transport hub, we have given away our car and only use feet, bikes and public transport\n\nto get around, we support local food producers and grow what we can ourselves in our own neighborhood.

Similarly win-win scenarios abound in this space e.g. tourism, public health, efficiency and cost reduction, new\n\ntechnology and innovation, green jobs ...... and much can be made of each step we make on our way to Net Zero. Consideration\nneeds to be given to changing market structures where current arrangements have been seen to work against the need for change.\nExamples include electricity where incumbents generators are happy to delay the build of renewable generation - for fear of lowering\n\nmarket prices and disturbing windfall profits. If we are to see a widespread electrification of transport and industry then it is likely that\nnew wind and geothermal generation will be needed post haste. Similarly infrastructure provision such as EV Charging requires a role\n\nfor the state either significant funding or direct action (e.g. California) - here benefits are spread widely and do not make a commercial\nprofit easily achieved.",

Investment and business decisions are generally multi-year choices, and the government has\n\nresponsibility to provide clear directions across all sectors of the economy.

For example, bans on sale of petrol or diesel vehicles after 2040\n\nin the UK and sooner in other countries, getting the power grid to 100% renewables as in Iceland.

Therefore, ultimately, emissions must go to zero, and likely need to go negative some\ntime in the next few decades to avoid that 2°C threshold.

  "Yes, I would like to make some points about how we get to negative Nett emissions by 2050: It’s pretty obvious really, we need a\npretty much wholesale change from animal protein to plant based protein diets across the world and an all but complete shift from\nanimal agriculture to growing tree crops (avocados, other fruit, nuts), grains, ground nuts, pulses etc. Farmers don’t have to stop\n\nfarming, they just have to stop farming animals. There are so many other reasons for moving away from animal farming (surface water\npollution, aquafer pollution, poor production of protein per unit of land, per unit of water) that if we are going to feed the worlds 9\n\nbillion people we can’t afford to stay with such an inefficient means of production. And if we care about other living creatures what\nplace does eating them have? We need create carbon stores wherever possible. One is a “wood first” basis for all our buildings, so\n\nyou have to have a very peculiar reason to use steel or concrete columns and beams in commercial buildings as well as domestic. We\nneed to have an earth first approach to adding thermal mass in buildings (eg asking why can’t you use earth floors, earth walls etc in\n\nthis situation). Why are you not using carbon storing strawbale insulation rather than glass fibre batts (that have been produced at\n1000°C). Why are you not using timber windows and doors? This is not just to reduce emissions from steel, concrete, fibreglass\nmanufacture, but to have our commercial buildings as well as residential buildings acting as carbon stores. We need to have thermal\n\npower stations sited where the residual heat can be used to displace the coal burnt in greenhouses (like the Waimea plains here in\nNelson), that supplies heat and electricity just at the time that heat and power is needed (winter evenings when the grid is\n\nstruggling), but furthermore is designed to produce biochar to permanently lock up the carbon the trees have absorbed from the\natmosphere. And this biochar can be used as a soil enhancer as well as a permanent carbon store. And of course we need to\n\nreafforest most of the country, a lot of it with perpetual native carbon forests – certainly areas within 10m for every 1m of width of\nwatercourse. We need to move freight by the most efficient means of steel wheels on steel rails using electricity as the fuel, by\nextending and electrifying the rail network in the country (the argument of double handling costs is largely taken over by using curtain\n\nsider containers (perhaps using the additional advantage of containers of being able to be left in factories to be loaded at their\nleisure), taken by electric short range trucks, to the railhead, container moved directly from truck to rail wagon, taken by rail to\n\ndestination where container is transferred to electric truck and to destination – again perhaps left to be unloaded at the destinations\nleisure. Electric main trunk lines are of course a well established technology, but electric delivery trucks are already available too.\n\nSettlement patterns are a crucial and overlooked way of transitioning to a low carbon, necessarily energy efficient way of living. It is\nhard to see sprawling suburbia often covering productive soils, ever being able to be served well or efficiently by public or active\n\ntransport. Additionally it is a waste of resources with the extra length of trench, pipes, footpath, and roadway. We need to be free to\nbuild a second dwelling on our close in suburbs (building a second dwelling in far flung suburbs does nothing, that is not what I am\nasking for), make it easier to build up to our side boundaries 2 stories. The mantra needs to be, the next time you buy a new house\n\n(and I believe we do this every 7 years on average) buy closer to where you work, school or recreate. Electric Bikes, Cycles, buses in\nbus lanes, trams and trains on their separate networks need to be acknowledged as the only way of dealing with road congestion:\n\nwidespread commuting by electric cars, however worthy a replacement for fossil cars in terms of climate change, are still just as much\na disaster for urban form, livable cities and urban life. So whilst of course there needs to be a savage feebate for motor vehicles\n\ncoming into the country, with high emitting vehicles of any type paying a lot in feebates, while the most efficient in terms of CO2\nemissions getting a big grant towards their purchase price from the feebate scheme, we mustn’t kid ourselves that electric cars will\n\ndo anything to improve the inefficient land use car commuting demands. With roads and car parking taking up at least a half of our\ncities walkability is destroyed, liveable cities are impossible. Sewerage Schemes and Landfills should be designed to be first and\n\nforemost methane producers to generate a supply of non fossil gas. Certain gas uses like cooking with gas are not so easy to\nsubstitute out with electricity. Renewable methane availability will be a good substitute.",

  "As a farmer I would like to make a couple of points. 1. The wording of Agriculture not being in the emissions trading scheme is\nincorrect and misleading - plus it makes us look like we are being subsidised by the city majority. Agricultural emissions, I assume, are\n\nMethane produced by Ruminants and Nitrous oxide. Methane (CH4) produced by ruminants in a steady state (i.e. numbers not\nchanging) is increasing carbon in the atmosphere by ZERO (unlike Methane from the the oil and gas industry, which is a by-product,\n\nwhere all added carbon is cumulative in the atmosphere). I started farming in 1980 and if the stock numbers are the same now as\nthen - my livestock have added ZERO carbon or methane to the atmosphere so therefore ZERO CLIMATE CHANGE, but all my usage\nof coal oil limestone and gas, including methane has increased the concentration in the atmosphere therefore aiding man induced\n\nclimate change. How could it be justified to charge a farmer for livestock produced methane if that methane is in a steady state and\nnot adding any carbon to the atmosphere or adding to man induced climate change. Methane is a short lived gas of approx 9-12\n\nyears. I realise the planet would be better off if sheep, cattle and deer were not ruminants but us farmers are helping to pay for world\nleading research into minimising livestock methane emissions. I believe the non farming community do not understand that livestock\n\ndo not produce carbon - they recycle it. Generally farmers are doing their best to minimise Nitrous Oxide emissions. 2. As I have\nalready stated I believe many people do not realise that forestry just buys the planet a little time and will not permanently mitigate our\n\ncoal, oil, limestone and gas emissions. I say this as someone who has planted many thousands of Pinetrees from an early age till now.",

  "Nowhere in the report did I see a mention of the role soil carbon plays. Moving forward it is essential any carbon budgeting done\n\nfactors in the role soil carbon can play in fighting climate change.

  "1. Consumption-based emissions The global carbon accounting system is based on a production-based approach. It is much easier\nto account for emissions occurring within the national boundary. However, I think that the carbon 'conversation' needs to widen to\n\ninclude consumption-based emissions. Consumption-based emissions (also known as embodied, embedded or Scope 3 emissions)\nare the carbon emissions associated with producing the goods and services which we buy (including from overseas). We need to be\n\nmore aware of the emissions associated with imported goods (and increasingly services) we use, so that action programmes are\nenhanced to look at reducing these consumption-based emissions. For example, a recent study by the C40 Cities Climate\n\nLeadership Group has shown that consumption-based emissions in Oceania cities are the highest of the 79 cities in the study.\nTherefore, I think there is one important gap in the discussion document – the sole focus on territorial-based emissions with no\nmention of consumption-based emissions. Typically for highly developed countries (like NZ), consumption-based emissions are\n\nhigher than territorial-based emissions, for example UK (see below). UK example…  Territorial-based emissions – 2015 = 492.4 mt\nCO2e, 34% lower than 1995 (744.3 mt)  Consumption-based emissions – 2015 = 847 mt CO2, 19% lower than 1997 (1,042 mt)\n\nConsumption-based emissions 71% more than territorial-based emissions.  Sources o\nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/provisional-uk-greenhouse-gasemissions-national-statistics-2017 o\n\nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/uks-carbon-footprint  Further analysis here - http://www.emissions.leeds.ac.uk/ Motu has\nundertaken some consumption-based analysis for NZ – https://motu.nz/ourwork/environment-and-resources/emission-\nmitigation/shaping-new-zealands-low-emissionsfuture/whos-going-green-decomposing-the-change-in-household-consumption-\n\nemissions-2006- 2012/. The work didn’t include estimating total consumption-based emissions, but did produce an average\nhousehold total of 15.6 t CO2-e. So, I think the Zero Carbon Bill should include some consideration of consumption-based emissions,\n\nin addition to its primary focus being on territorial-based emissions. This could be as a subsidiary measure, including targets and\nassociated advice and reporting. Of course, if there is comparable emissions reduction action globally then we can expect the\n\n‘embodied’ emissions of imported goods and services to reduce as NZ’s territorial-based emissions reduce. But, there is no\nguarantee that this will be the case, and the rate of reduction is likely to differ between countries. By including a consumption-based\n\nemissions element in our regulated system then the impact of our consumption can be appropriately monitored and form part of the\ncommunication of progress",

I believe that within this idea is way to recast agriculture in NZ as a huge contributor to the solutions we need\n\nfor a zero carbon NZ, and not just, as they are sometimes portrayed, the largest contributor to the problem in the country at the\nmoment.",
  "Clearly this is necessary once a national climate change risk assessment is completed, and Local Body Government needs to be\nclosely involved in this process. A Central Government / Local Government / Regional Council sharing of information and resources is\nessential if the effects of climate change are going to be managed effectively, and in the interests of all citizens.",
  "I can remember my father complaining about climate change many years ago in the forties. It is not a new phenomenon and is at\nleast partly a natural occurrence. Are we not supposed to be coming out of a minor ice age?",
  "Thank you for the opportunity to comment on this legislation. As a climate activist (Climate Karanga Marlborough) and retired\ngeoscientist, I think this is very important goal (net zero GHG emissions by 2050) and yet, will be very difficult for our society to\n\naccomplish. I appreciate that citizen consultation is the best way to create a solution that will stick and (hopefully) will be fair to all New\nZealanders.",
  "Let's get on with it - we have waited too long already.",
  "Thank you for acting with urgency.",
  "Regarding global warming. I hope central government will help Councils in the matter of dealing with coastal properties that have to\nbe retreated from. In fairness, who should pay?",
  "We need to start behaving like the \"clean green\" country we pretend to be",
  "I am a qualified New Zealand lawyer with a Masters Degree in Environmental and Energy Law from New York University. I am 27 years\nold and will see substantial impacts of climate change in my lifetime. I think it is important that in addition to setting targets and plans,\n\nNew Zealand indicates its real present commitment to taking action on climate change, by introducing a functional price on carbon. A\nZero Carbon Act could be passed to include a set of current policies to help reduce emissions straight away, and the credibility of the\n\nlaw would be boosted if we saw action being taken right away.",
  "If we don’t act now and commit to zero emissions by 2050, the impacts of climate change will cost our country billions. Better to\nprevent the worst climate change by acting now. Do it!",
  "I wish to tautoko the comprehensive and thoughtful submission made to the Ministry by Generation Zero. In particular, I want to\n\nhighlight their points about Te Tiriti: \"Zero Carbon Act must honour Te Tiriti o Waitangi by giving effect to meaningful partnership\nbetween iwi and the Crown. The Zero Carbon Act’s targets and policies must be made consistently with the tino rangatiratanga of iwi\n\nand hapū, as enshrined in Te Tiriti.\" Please note, I am happy for the Ministry to publish my name and submission but do NOT consent\nto the publication of my email address in any public forum. My email is provided only for the purpose of being contacted by the\n\nMinistry in regard to this submission.",
  "However, the costs and administrative burden of doing so should be minimised. It is important that the Commission and the\n\nGovernment have a good picture of what is happening in the adaptation space across a range of organisations. The reporting\nrequirement should be integrated with existing reporting requirements e.g. Annual Reports rather than creating an additional\n\nreporting process.",
  "The economic cost of acting far outweighs the benefits as demonstrated by the modelling. As such the ideological imposition of the\n\nbill will create a more adverse outcome than the effects it is seeking to mitigate (even if they are correct).",
  "It won’t hurt us all that much, will it? An Island in the middle of a big ocean? All the effects will be buffered by the ocean, won’t they?\nYup. Likely true for, though a lot of our infrastructure will end up underwater... in 100 years or so. Yet there is another inconvenient\n\ntruth that New Zealand is blind to. A devastatingly “inconvenient truth” that will be more serious for NZ than most places and will\narrive sooner. As the climate starts to unravel, and delivers regular shocks to the economic system, (very likely by 2030, certain by\n\n2035) the cost of CO2 will be forced above $100 per tonne. That’s a generational change, a recognition of peril, and a shift that will\naffect the whole world. There is no \"free trade\". There is no \"free\". At that level the price of fuel for shipping triples, the cost of\nshipping doubles, and our trade IS LESS THAN HALF ITS PREVIOUS LEVELS.!!! At their best the “free trade” agreements give us a 1 or\n\n2% incremental increase. Cutting trade in half isn’t thinkable here in NZ Yet it WILL HAPPEN! Whether we choose to prepare or not,\nclimate destabilization will affect trade and it will affect OUR trade more than anyone else’s because... ...we are further from\n\neverywhere than anyone else is. When we export wood and import wood furniture, we have damaged our economy and the\nenvironment. The benefit of the “cheaper” furniture does not offset the long term damage. When we export Apples and import\n\nApplesauce, we have damaged the economy and the environment just the same. When we allow industry to depend on foreign\nsuppliers of critical components, foreign suppliers at risk of failing as climate worsens, we damage our national security. Ricardo\n\nnever, in spite of the blunders in his treatise on \"comparative advantage\" pushed the notion that is common knowledge in New\nZealand today, that we should ONLY make the things we are good at. We can't afford to continue to believe that. The most important\nand difficult change? We have to change our minds. This is the LEAST step we can take, and it needs to be taken now.",
  "Until we address critical issues such as weather warfare under the guise of chemtrails, induced earthquakes and cyclones (all man\nmade) we are just \"pissing into the wind\" with cheap window dressing whilst avoiding confronting the REAL CONTRIBUTORS TO\n\nEXTREME WEATHER which is our biggest concern-just ask the people of Tasman, Tolaga Bay and Coromandel, Our weather is being\nENGINEERED by psychopaths who worship and benefit from carnage,destruction and induced debt !",
  "Grow lots and lots of plantation's of tree's for harvest, and lots and lots of native bush all over New Zealand to help Mother Earth do\n her job!!. (( I am not a Greenie either ))",
  "At present only forestry is considered to be a carbon sink, whereas fast growing plants are not recognised. Such as grass, cabbage\n\ntrees, manuka and flax (riparian plantings). Riparian planting should be undertaken for all new developments to protect waterways\nand to act as a carbon sink in town and country. When making decisions about different communities and regions there should be\nopportunities for those with local knowledge to have input as in the past decisions have been made by groups of people in\n\nWellington that do not take into account local conditions and things that could easily be solved by good communication with all\nparties. For example: Spending huge amounts of money on the Brynderwyn Hills when the problem had been solved by reducing the\n\nspeed limit to 80 kph. (Information from local Fire Parties who attend accidents in that area). And now they are talking about building a\nwhole new motorway away from the Brynderwyns. A waste of taxpayers money. Very poor planning. Let's not make the same mistake\n\ntwice.",
  "Huge challenges require great courage to face fierce opposition to worthy goals. Success comes from collaboration. The true battle\nis always for the hearts and minds of the people. People follow leaders who model their values in their actions. Be bold and follow\n\nthrough.",
  "The Zero Carbon Bill must be designed to ensure the targets cannot change between different governmental parties. All parties\nwhen in power must adhere to the goal in a manner that is beneficial to the environment.",
  "It is about time NZ put this kind of action into place. I am thrilled that we are putting into place the targets for zero carbon by 2050...\n\nand if possible to make it happen sooner. This is the most critical issue facing humanity, and we must also ensure that we look after\nthose who can least do so. We must lead the way and all do more than our fair share to make it easier for all. THANK YOU.",
  "I fully support this initiative. It is closely based on the UK model which is proving successful. It is a pity this legislation wasn't\nimplemented much earlier in NZ.",
  "I would like to see 2050 adopted as a minimum and if possible a shorter timescale should be considered.",
  "On a personal note, I am a Building Scientist (I make buildings more energy efficient as a tool for mitigating climate change) and I have\n\njust had my role made redundant due to the large engineering firm no longer seeing any work in this area. This is really upsetting as\nwe know NZ's building stock needs serious assistance to become healthier and more energy efficient, and that there needs to be\n\ndrastic changed for NZ to reach its emissions targets - yet there is no work in this area in the buildings sector. So, I would love to see\nnew regulations put in place to make our buildings more energy efficient as a tool for mitigating climate change, as well as healthier.\n\nThis will require specialist skills like mine. From my experience this needs to be regulated. We can not rely on the developers or\narchitects/engineers to make this happen because the majority of people will only do it if they HAVE to. General comments:\nAgriculture needs to be targeted, there needs to be mandatory reporting on GHG emissions and targets by each company, as well as\n\na plan for reaching the targets. Without this, we will not reach our international commitment to the Paris agreement as companies\ntend to do the minimum required.",
  "NO.",
  "The economy was constructed around oil and gas without accounting for costs of climate change or resource depletion. Either of\n\n these factors make the consumption of fossil fuels entirely uneconomic now. That's a catastrophic mistake which needs to be\n corrected but where's your transition plan? Banning oil and gas is the right decision but it means shutting down Methenex and Tiwai,\n you need to face that consequence as it impacts many people's lives. There's going to be a huge disruption to the economy and\n\n jobs won't be replaced. That's an inevitable consequence of increasing technological progress, as jobs are replaced (a good thing)\n unless people take more leisure time there aren't enough jobs to go around. This should be a luxury problem a benefit but we have\n turned it into an economic disaster through inequality. As we have stopped looking for oil and gas in NZ and globally we risk price\n\n spikes, the next government will simply roll back your plans in the face of these anyway. Only an idealist would believe the\n government can stand against the corporations who own the country. What other businesses will shut down if we are importing\n $12/GJ LNG from under the Pilliga forest via SANTOS? I think this legislation is well intentioned but ineffectual. Lots of highly paid\n useless wafflers without any skin in the game pontificating on what everyone else should do. ",
  "Please please please pass this bill for the future of our country and our younger generations.",
  "The old \"divide and conquer\" approach will not work. It will require unparalleled transparency and collaboration.",
  "Finding carbon sinks is vital - we need a national campaign to promote planting trees/leafy gardens/valuing & not chopping down\nmature trees",
  "Healthy soil can absorb methane via Methantrophs. More works needs to be done here but be very careful on taxing methane from\nruminants. Science will tell us that ruminants are vital to rebuilding topsoil/OM on cropping farms, and storing high levels of carbon on\n\npasture land. Dung Beetles are crucial for reducing N2O and maybe even methane. Bare soil ie winter cropping is very bad, diverse\nforages and better grazing practises without N fertilser is the future. We Extracting fossil fuels are the main problem, so we should be\npromoting natural products like wool, hemp etc. We need to use Regenarative farming priniclples that not only improve the\n\nenvironment, but demand a greater premium of product prices is the future. Synthetic proteins cannot claim that they can improve\nour natural resources. Farming is not the problem, it is how we are farming. Photo's below demonstrate some of our different forages\n\nfor stock, and harvesting wheat while having N fixing clover underneath and keeps a live plant growing that protects the soil and\nrequires no N fertilser.",
  "If we look at the 'Paris Agreement' and targets of 11% below 1990 levels and look at population growth the logistics of reducing\ngreenhouse gases become exceedingly difficult. In 1990 New Zealand had a population of 3.414 million, today our population at 4.76\n\nmillion is 39% higher. We had to be 11% below 1990 levels so effectively at this moment in time every person that was alive in 1990\nshould have a carbon footprint 50% smaller than they did back then. But our Paris target was for 2030 (estimated population 5.2\n\nmillion or a 9.5% increase); so by then every person that was alive in 1990 must have a carbon footprint 60% smaller than it was back\nthen. If we continue this extrapolation to 2050 then the carbon footprint of someone alive in 1990 needs to be 78% smaller than it\n\nwas back then. This is totally unrealistic; the only logical way to stem greenhouse gas emissions is to STOP population growth and\nmore importantly STOP IMMIGRATION. Global warming is an international problem caused by globalisation; one where the major\nemitters are the Asian block of countries (China, India, Japan, Korea, Indonesia, Phillipines, etc) whom emitt >50% of all greenhouse\n\ngases. International pressure either through diplomacy (foreign affairs) or trade (an embargo on goods with high carbon footprints)\nmust be imposed to arrest the growth in greenhouse gases from China and India especially. We MUST REDUCE ELECTRICITY PRICES\n\nif New Zealand is going to remain competitive. The free-market model for electricity implemented by the last 2 National governments\nhas resulted in New Zealand having some of the most expensive electricity prices in the world. In India electricity is 5-6.5c per unit, in\n\nChina 8c per unit, in Canada 10c per unit, in the USA 12c per unit, in the UK 20c per unit; but here in NZ it is 28c per unit. When we\nare reliant on electricity for energy and transport we cannot afford to pay the current price. Quite simple we will not be competitive in\ninternational markets. We must transition away from current agricultural commodities to horticulture. This should start now with\n\nseeding finance for synthetic milk and synthetic meat production. Agriculture must pay for high livestock emissions which will\nenhance the rate of change. A tax on nitrogen-based fertilizers must be imposed to reduce nitrates in surface and groundwater; and\n\nreduce emissions of nitrous oxide. One of the principle risks is we are locked into Keynesian economics which is a paradigm requiring\ncompounded growth in all economic indicators to provide a workable framework for our economy. How can we have an economy with\ncompounded growth year on year, when in fact we require compounded recessions year on year in our carbon footprint? How can\n\ncompounded human impacts on ecosystems continue year on year when we want compounded growth of biodiversity to sequester\ncarbon? How can compounded population growth continue year on year when the overshoot in world population currently exceeds 2\n\nbillion people and overshoot in the New Zealand population is almost 1 million people? What is the model for sustainability, because it\ncertainly isn’t what we have got at the minute.",
  "We should not be passive in making targets but be need to be bold and help lead the world.",
  "I would not like my name to appear in the summary of submissions that the ministry may publish",
  "Please do not publish my responses online.",
  "Thank you for getting this process going and for your efforts to seek the views of the nation",
  "We are a small country with a history of innovation which should make us ideally placed to enact real, substantial and revolutionary\nchange. We must resist the calls of those who for economic or social reasons want to retain the status quo. We cannot continue to\n\nuse resources and create waste (be it landfill or gas emissions) in the way we are doing at the moment. Investment in a 'greener'\neconomy will pay dividends in the the future not just in terms of climate change but also economical, social and lifestyle benefits that\n\nneed to be for all in Aotearoa.",
  "I am excited by the setting up of the Commission, and the zero-carbon bill. Done well, we have the opportunity to make a real\ndifference to the future of NZ and the world, in the face of the biggest challenge humanity has ever faced. I have just participated in\n\nthe first Lead Author meeting for the 6th Assessment Report of the IPCC, and I am reminded strongly of the stakes, the level of\ncommitment already at play, and the urgency of action.",
  "Thank you for all your work getting the bill to this stage, it is looking great. There is hope for a low carbon future in NZ!",
  "To me it seems that to date the accounting system, including the ETS, has been broken. Emissions in a biological cycle should not\n\nbe included. Forestry is not the fix all that government seems to think, it has many negative effects as well. If the accounting is done\nproperly I suspect that NZ's emissions in the world scheme of things are miniscule. There is alot of other pollution here that should\n\nbe dealt to, look at all the garbage that stores like The Warehouse, and the other \"cheap crap\" stores which are popping up\neverywhere are bringing into the country all of which will ultimately end up in the landfill. Why don't you do something about that? And\n\nreducing packaging - the gains that we make by bringing our re-usable bags to the supermarket are all lost by the likes of Pams\nputting half a dozen tomatoes in a plastic container. And when you buy something the size of a matchbox on line, and it comes in a\nwhole lot of packaging? Why don't you do something about that? I think we will be buried in our own rubbish long before we run out of\n\noxygen or get frazzled by the sun.",
  "Concern about legislating this - if there is voluntary involvement, that's fine, but don't create more bureaucracy!",
  "I believe that this is one of the greatest opportunities we will ever have to not only beat climate change but to also develop a\ncohesive, motivated and a far more equable society."
