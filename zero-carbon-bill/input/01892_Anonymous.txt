We need to be heavy handed. People are too selfish to take initiative and help the cause. We'll never make our targets if theres no

consequences set out. But while there are consequences, there should also be incentives and rewards to encourage change
across all of our emissions sectors. As an example I'd love it if the idea of getting a bank loan to buy a $20,000 EV was actually a

cheaper and more easily achievable long term option than owning a petrol vehicle for New Zealanders. Maybe the govt could work
with banks to provide lower interest rate loans for anyone buying an EV? No GST on EVs, while increasing GST on petrol cars to 30%.
Working with power companies to provide lower electricity rates for charging EVs at home etc.
