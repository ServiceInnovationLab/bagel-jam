Multiple schemes and incentives should be introduced to assist in meeting targets including: improving building code towards higher
energy performance, introduction of compulsory energy rating system. Incentives for EV's and PV should be looked at. With coal

being the main and growing source of global fossil CO2, alternatives to coal should be a high priority with planned the transition away
from coal mining and coal export. NZ should work with international partners on transition to low carbon transport for tourism and
trade.
