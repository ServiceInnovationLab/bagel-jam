While the global economic model is failing the vast majority of people on the planet, it is not failing all of the people the same. I want to

recommend that the coalition government considers UNDRIP and the Treaty of Waitangi and that a Zero Carbon Act adequately
engages the human rights issues that arise from the fossil-fuel industry; that is, the right to clean air to breathe and clean water to

drink, now and for generations to come.
