I am a General Practitioner and support Ora Taiao’s position. I am personally prepared to forgo future gains in income and quality of

life, to pay more income tax and have my cost of living higher and ease of living reduced if it means my children will not be faced with
the crisis of climate change. I would much prefer strong immediate action with impacts on current GDP than reactive responses once

the crisis is here. In saying that, I am very concerned about the impacts of change on our most vulnerable citizens. I do not want to
see another 1984, nor GFC scale tidal wave of unemployment. The most vulnerable should be protected and supported. The Treaty

must be respected. I do not support simple consultation of Māori. They are the original and ongoing kaitiaki of NZ/Aotearoa and
should have a significant and, ideally, leading role within the Commission. Thank you for your consideration.
