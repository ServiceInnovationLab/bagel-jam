I'm excited to see this happening and I appreciate the effort that is going into consultations such as the public meeting I attended in

Invercargill. I feel proud to be a citizen of New Zealand and I'm so pleased to see our new government acting so quickly and
confidently on this issue. Thank you for the opportunity to participate.
