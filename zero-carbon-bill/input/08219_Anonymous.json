I am concerned about if we uptake electric vehicles - what will happen to the cars we already have - how will we dispose of them? I

would hope the bill outlines how we will transition to an 100% renewable transport model effectively. Also regarding the recycling
crisis arising from China - I hope this bill will set out actions for investing in onshore industries to manage our own waste. To be more

sustainable, we have to invest in sustainable initiatives. Kaitiakitanga is very important to me as a born and bred kiwi. These values
should play a large part in our actions for net carbon zero by 2050. There is no second chance. We have to act NOW. I agree with the

points raised below the following on page 41 "For the Climate Change Commission to be successful and become a trusted and
stable part of New Zealandâ€™s government institutions, it would need." Finally, Is there going to be legislation that ensures foreign

corporations comply by these plans if they do business in NZ? E.g. film industry, international business events, foreign exporters to
NZ, airlines etc.?
