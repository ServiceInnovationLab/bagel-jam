Food and fibre producers in NZ are concerned at a fundamental level with Kaitiakitanga and Legacy. They will want to adopt and adapt
to this legislation. The Government needs to consider how they can best support farmers to make the required changes, without

pushing their costs of production up so much that their customers start buying from higher emitting competitors. There is no point in
putting a sector out of business that is globally an emissions efficient system. The goal should be to support greater levels of
emissions efficiencies in that system. I would also like to highlight the Government's need to prioritise training and capability for

people - we will need scientists and technology developers, but we might also need different primary sector skills or retraining
farmers if we end up with land use changes. Finally, I want to exhort the Government to consider this legislation alongside the full

gambit of environmental issues facing food and fibre producers and on which they have worked hard already. There is no gain if we
sacrifice water quality work or biodiversity in order to reduce emissions. Policy to reduce emissions should ensure it does not have

adverse environmental outcomes in other aspects. Equally, BIOSECURITY needs to be kept front of mind when adopting or
embracing technology for emissions reductions, especially from off-shore.
