I am appalled at the misinformation that surrounds 'climate change'. Those who promulgate the illusion most are those who know
least about it - ie the Green Party. I have looked at their academic credentials - note one Green MP has any science background at all.

Those scientists who claim to know about climate change tend to cherry-pick their data because being a climate-change believer is a
guarantee of funding.
