I believe an important part of moving towards zero emissions is to reduce/eliminate the farming and consumption of animals and their

products. Consuming animal products is detrimental to our health and only places a further toll on our health system. Therefore the
NZ Government should be focusing on this issue as a way of reducing the harm animal agriculture places on our environment and

our health.
