Just to reiterate that climate change is probably the most (but not only) environmental crisis that we face, and there is a risk of its
turning into an existential crisis. We should concentrate on removing our contribution to climate change forcing. We should also note

that the impacts of climate change may not change because of our actions in this country alone, so adaptation strategies should,
initially, assume that climate change will continue to track on the worst case scenario.
