Carbon sequestration is of prime importance. eg. Making charcoal/biochar from biomass that would otherwise be wasted, and

returning it to the soil; Changing agricultural practices to achieve carbon sequestrations by changing to perenial pasture grasses;
Managed grazing, so that perenail grass roots draw down carbon in their roots when excess root mass is shed by the plants. Organic

agriculture, Silvopasture. These are just some of the ways carbon can be sequestered. See the book "Drawdown" Edited by Paul
Hawken for more ways.
