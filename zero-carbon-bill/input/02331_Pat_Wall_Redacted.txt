Once again, the legislation must have teeth and not be something that can be pushed aside by the next government. There must be
consistency. We can not afford the back and forth that we have had since National pushed aside Simon Upton. We cannot have this

be a political football. We must be united. Furthermore, we need to communicate to the public that the government will need to use
tax money to help industry and individuals transition. To some, this will sound like socialism and there may be push back. However,

we all pay taxes to be used for the greater good and they should be used to help NZ as a whole to transition. Whether that means
helping the dairy industry to kick coal, or if it means helping a poor west coast community to transition or poor families to retrain; then

so be it!
