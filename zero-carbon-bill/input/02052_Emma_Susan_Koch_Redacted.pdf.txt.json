household sufficiency is an aim that remediates emmissions through circular systems for household production, reducing waste and

optimising natural resources. solar is a part of this, and the commodification of soil for food production and carbon capture. total
recycling systems, and independance from large scale industry reduces waste and production emmissions. neighbourhood centers

are required to support microindustry by coordinating microeconomies, providing essential services and psychosocial support.
walkable communities reduce reliance on transport. data management systems provide a wealth of information across demographics
for the maintenance of natural infrastructure, and social outcomes. church and iwi organisations, libraries and education providers are

excellent existing host venues for neighbourhood centers. inclusion in council forums allows community members to participate in
planning committees, make group submissions, and vote in online referendums effecting national legislation.
