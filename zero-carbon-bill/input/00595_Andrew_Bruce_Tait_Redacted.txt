This is a landmark bill for NZ. Emissions targets need to be set and reported on and adaptation needs to be better aligned and

coordinated. The most important element of this bill will be that successive governments do not have the power to significantly
change the targets or the role of the commission as a policy choice (e.g. make it an election issue). NZ needs long-term certainty on

our climate change response and goals, and this will only happen if politics are not allowed to interfere.
