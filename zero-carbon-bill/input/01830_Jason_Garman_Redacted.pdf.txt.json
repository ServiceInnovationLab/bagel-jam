Climate Change is a global problem – it cannot be tackled by countries in isolation. New Zealand must demonstrate global leadership
and match its bold domestic emissions reduction agenda: by having an equally ambitious climate change strategy abroad. Access to

climate finance is a matter of climate justice – those who have contributed least to the causes of climate change are typically the
most vulnerable to its impacts and have the least resources to respond. We must take responsibility for our global emissions and the

climate impacts that we have contributed to. It’s very important that all New Zealanders have their say on how we make the shift to a
zero carbon future here in New Zealand but we must also help the world’s most vulnerable communities across the Pacific adjust to

the impacts on climate change. We must ensure that the Zero Carbon Bill is transparent. This means the bill must include a
requirement to produce annual reports about New Zealand’s international climate change contributions in order to ensure that the
Pacific countries get the support they need and can plan to adapt to their changing environment. Transparency in the Bill will promote

public engagement and political accountability. New Zealanders will be able to understand the international contributions we are
making and as a nation, we will be able to stand tall that we are supporting our Pacific neighbours adapt to their climate change reality.

New Zealand has demonstrated global leadership with our commitment to stopping oil and gas exploration – now let us continue that
moral leadership and include transparency in what and how we support climate change efforts abroad, particularly in the Pacific.
