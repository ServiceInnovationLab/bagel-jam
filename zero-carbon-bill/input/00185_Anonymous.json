We have committed would being emissions free by 2050 and I commend the courage to do this (bearing in mind the science shows
us that this will only leave us with an outside chance of reaching 2 degrees). To be emissions free we are looking at about 10%

reductions per year. Has the magnitude of this task been mapped out in terms of carbon budgets for each individual in New Zealand?
Starting from next year, people need to be emissions free for 1 month a year; this means no flying, driving or creating emissions from
food, power, water, heating. Do people realise this? I think the government needs to be honest with the public, 10% reductions per

year are probably not compatible with a growing economy This issue is something we have not historically had to deal with on a
global scale. It is unprecedented and therefore requires unprecedented policy making. Government needs to set the course and be

honest with the public about the situation. We are facing an enormous challenge - greater than any generation in history. Perhaps it is
prudent for the act to include penalties for politicians and leaders who do not act. Scientist attest to dire consequences if politicians

do not take drastic steps. This means MAJOR changes as a society in the next decade.
