My degree from the University of California was in environmental sciences. In my opinion, the entire climate change hysteria is driven
 by two factors. One, the generous government grants given to scientists acting as prostitutes. Two, politicians jumping on the
 bandwagon to secure votes. The earth is now in an 800 year warming cycle, interrupted briefly by global cooling during the post WWII
 industrial boom. The causes of global warming and the increase of CO2 are not related to the kinds of human activity usually
 mentioned. It is totally irresponsible for the New Zealand government to throw wrenches into the NZ economy in the name of zero

 carbon emissions.
