Yes. We are not doing enough, and the Paris agreement is not nearly enough either. We need a carbon tax, we need electric cars to
be cheaper and we need stricter run off targets for dairy farms. I mean, come on. You’re letting 15,000 dairy cows in the Mackenzie’s

country on acrid soil? On the shores of the clearest lake in our country. This is a joke. This country needs to step up and do
something tangible and world leading in fighting climate change. Or people of my generation will be left to clean it up. And my kids will

have to clean it up too with maybe irreversible damage to our climate.
