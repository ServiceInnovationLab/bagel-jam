I am old enough to remember living in a non-plastic, non-touristic New Zealand, where milk and houses were cheap and affordable

and good quality, university was free, medical care was almost free, cars were expensive and rare, and we had many local industries
producing good quality goods. New Zealand families could afford to travel around New Zealand, though not overseas, so we grew to
know and love our country. There were trains and ships as well as roads and cars. We hadn't embarked on the disastrous dairy

expansion at that point, but we knew that the world was beginning to be in crisis. If we had had governments then who had listened
to the warnings, we wouldn't be in this situation now. We could have made changes in energy production then. There was new

technology for wind energy, that was not adopted, there were new building techniques that used fewer resources, that were not
adopted. There were radical moves that took the country into a new world of unimagined wealth for a few, inequity and poverty for

many, cheap goods, luxury goods, cheap travel and overall huge debt, all of which has been killing the planet over time. It is unlikely
that this government or any other in the world will take the truly radical steps needed to address at least the current situation

effectively. But we can hope, for our grandchildren and great-grandchildren's sake.
