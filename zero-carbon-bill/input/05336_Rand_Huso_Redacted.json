If the government is serious about reducing our CO2 emissions, they'll begin by dropping the national speed limit, perhaps to 80 (the
USA dropped to 90 during the oil-embargo). Energy required to maintain a velocity is quadratic with speed, so lower speeds should

conserve significant fuel and allow for smaller and lighter commute vehicles to operate safely. Cargo should be sent via rail or cargo
ship and not over expensive roadways (road damage is exponential with the weight of the vehicle - and we used to have a law about

this very thing.) Carpooling should be encouraged - and since we know where and when everyone goes (thanks to their cellular
phone automatic registration messages), the government could encourage those who travel in parallel to join together for their
commute. Working from home should also be encouraged. Diesel Road User Charges should be added at the fuel pump, so those

inefficient vehicles actually pay their fair share relative to those diesel vehicles that are more economical - leaving it as it is adds an
unnecessary overhead (purchasing the RUC) and gives heavy vehicles that damage the roads no incentive to improve their efficiency.

I have many such ideas, and I'm not seeing much of these ideas discussed anywhere. But perhaps it's because I don't watch TV and
the broadcast radio sucks.
