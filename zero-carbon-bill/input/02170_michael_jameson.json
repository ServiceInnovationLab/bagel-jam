I thought that there was supposed to a DISCUSSION, but in fact we are required to accept the Minister is correct - CO2 Emissions are
the cause of all our problems - and only discuss how far are we prepared to go to restrict its release to atmosphere. I think the

discussion needs to start a few steps earlier before we start to close down our economy!!!!!. I also think that all citizens need be
given real data, not subjective ideology and alarmist statements, so that they are able to endorse or discard the shrinking of our

economy by way of binding referendum. At the very least, they need to have a clear picture of what life in our country will look like with
the withdrawal hydrocarbons [the most cost efficient and concentrated source of energy currently available to humanity], and a clear

plan on how this energy source will be replaced given that: 1. wind and solar energy require more energy and resources to
manufacture than they are able to generate [ask Germany and Scandinavia who have said that these scources cannot replace
hydrocarbons]; 2. Nuclear energy is currently denied to New Zealanders by current legislation; and 3. Hydro energy resources are all-

but at maximum capacity. How any Government could deliberately commit its population to a reducing standard of living is difficult to
comprehend. It is time to STOP treating CO2 as a pollutant - it is not. ASK ANY PLANT!
