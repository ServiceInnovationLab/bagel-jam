I know there is no silver bullet to fix CC. Nevertheless long term gains will come from the high tech sector and we must stay up with
innovations and the govt must have resources to contribute and incentivize. Among the many technologies that are fast evolving in

China and India is nuclear thorium. The word nuclear is toxic politically in NZ but we must change that when Thorium technologies
evolve. At present our regulatory environment condemns everything vaguely nuclear and fails to distinguish between environmentally

safe and unsafe. Potentially Thorium plants could: Be scaleable down to units the size of shipping containers thus eliminating
kilometers of high voltage transmission lines and our whole national grid The energy could benefit the whole economy and replace
gas generation It can make safe nuclear waste It can produce rare earths as a by product and break China's monopoly on these

products that are so vital for high tech solutions It could provide abundant power for our future green transport and all the other uses
we have for it. Tree planting is e temporary fix. Reducing emissions is long term. Given abundant electrical energy we could clean up

our farming and industrial emissions too.
