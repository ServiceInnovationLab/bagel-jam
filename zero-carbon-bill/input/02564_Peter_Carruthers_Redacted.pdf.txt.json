Climate change signature in New Zealand is not strong to date. Auckland Airport long term average temperatures show approximately
0.5 degree increase in 50 years - and some of that could be related to increased aircraft frequency and surrounding urban

development which has elsewhere been noted to affect temperature observations. Over a similar period, Christchurch shows zero
net average temperature change. Average wind speeds, and number of stormy days has not increased at those locations either. So

maybe there is worse to come already loaded in the system with historical global emissions - that might be the case although I
believe that the alarmists and doomsayers vastly overstate this threat. One only has to review the ridiculous predictions of James
Hansen, Al Gore and other alarmists in the 1990's and early 2000's - none of those misleading prognostications have come to pass.

However even if worse is to come, nothing in this proposal will affect any of that one iota. So if anything focus only on those initiatives
where emission reductions can be shown to have a net economic benefit (or at worst neutral) within a short to medium time frame (3

- 5 years) - encouragement for an electric vehicle fleet may be applicable for example. Also focus on adaption where necessary. Don't
let the utopian planners get their hands on lots of cash.
