As I said before the science is not settled. For years now the climate change movement has silenced any scientists who try to speak

out against this ideologically driven crusade. The whole premise is flawed. You people have no concept of basic science. The sun
provides 99.99% of the planet's energy. As much as humans can influence the planet, our major impact is on species and land use.

So you should be much more worried about mass extinctions and deforestation if you really care about the environment. Stopping a
small country of 4.5 million people from functioning is going to do nothing when nations like the USA and China and India produce

thousands of times more pollution. Once again this whole exercise is to make the Green Party happy and to give Jacinda an anointed
path into a lifetime job at the United Nations. What a joke. History will judge you harshly for this.
