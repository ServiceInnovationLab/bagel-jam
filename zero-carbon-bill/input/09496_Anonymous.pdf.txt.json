I would like to advocate for a strategy of fair and just ‘economic adaptation’ towards a doughnut economic model. I use this term
‘economic adaptation’ to reference the exciting opportunity to redesign our low-carbon economy in a way ensures a just transition for

workers employed in high-carbon jobs while also ensure we take care of our most vulnerable in society. By moving away from a neo-
liberal focus on GDP as the only measure of prosperity, we can re-design an economy that sits within the doughnut of planetary
boundaries and focuses on the equality and well-being of the people. Urgent action will need to be taken to create a low-carbon

economy, for this reason it will be essential to strengthen the safety net created by our government so as to ensure that no one is
left behind on this journey.
