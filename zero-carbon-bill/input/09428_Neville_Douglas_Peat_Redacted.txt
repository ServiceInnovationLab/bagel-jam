Thank you for this useful format for making a submission. I am the author of a book on coastal hazards and climate change, with

particular reference to sea-level rise and increasing storminess in New Zealand and the atoll nations of the South Pacific - "The
Invading Sea", due to be released in October 2018 (The Cuba Press, Wellington).
