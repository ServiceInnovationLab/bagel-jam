I have been a Forest and Bird member for 40 years and am an active supporter of Tawharanui Open Sanctuary. I love tramping and

have recently tramped 300kms of the Te Araroa trail. I am involved in a very progressive local community garden. As a member of
Transition Towns Pt Chevalier I am actively involved in activities with the group to support sustainable living practices. I also feel we as

a wealthy country must address some of the excessive damage we have created to climate change that is affecting our Pacific Island
neighbours who are suffering the most and have been minimal emitters. It is because of these interests and social concerns and my

concern for the planet and for future generations that I fully support the Green Party in its aim to pass the Zero Carbon Act as
proposed.
