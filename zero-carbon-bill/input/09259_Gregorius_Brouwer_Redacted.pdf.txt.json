2 issues. Action should be taken now. Not plan-plan- and plan a bit more. Of course, do both, plan well, but do stuff now. The extra
taxes on fuel are a good idea. I would also like to see, really soon, buy-back subsidies or other stimuli for households and industry

feeding electricity into the net. Secondly: i consider myself green, but weak of resolve. I want to make green choices, but often don't
because 'my neighbours' (in a wide sense) do not. Point to make: I want to be forced to act green. That is why I voted for this

coalition government to come about. Thank you for your ear.
