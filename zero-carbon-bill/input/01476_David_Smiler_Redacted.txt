To reduce our carbon footprint I feel that the top of buildings in CDB areas of cities should have hanging gardens, gardens and trees

which will not only make the view from tall buildings such as hotels better but also provide employment for people to maintain these
rooftop gardens. Maybe start with Gisborne if you need a "guinea pig"
