I am attempting to launch a vehicle retrofitting project in Southland essentially creating a new industry and finding the process slow

and difficult due to the current bureaucratic process of government, so the need for a government lead "priority declaration" is seen
for such an industry to be able to move forward quickly, as there is urgency to begin the climate adaptation process, to take the

predicted 25 years to install a new fleet of EV's is a way too long timeframe, retrofitting the existing fleet would speed the process, be
a huge financial and environmental saving and provide employment at the same time, retrofitting may in fact become the best option

to replace our current ICE fleet due to global economic and trade circumstances, to not cut through the bureaucratic process could
otherwise be our downfall, a ministry official recently asked me how much would this retrofitting cost/ My response is how much will it
cost not to do so, both in an environmental and monetary sense. I wish to speak further at select committee stage about retrofitting

the New Zealand vehicle fleet.
