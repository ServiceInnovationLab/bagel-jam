1. The discussion document continually cites impact on economic growth as the main criterion for the cost of mitigation measures. It
is time that this language was changed. Growth is not necessarily an indicator of benefit, and is finite, ie unsustainable. It is time that

public wellbeing and fulfilment are incorporated as a factor in overall cost/ benefit analysis of climate change response. 2. Agricultural
emissions must be brought in immediately. Agriculture cannot be exempted any longer as it is becoming a massive subsidy which will

increasingly be paid for by other industries and the general public. 3. Terminology- As a final comment, I think the use of "carbon" as a
heading in Table 1 to describe the net zero carbon dioxide target option is confusing and misleading, since methane is also a carbon
containing gas. Stick with the full name of the gas in the table headings and all references to this option, ie "Carbon Dioxide".
