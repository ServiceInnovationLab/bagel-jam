If one swings a bucket of water around in a circle the arc it describes is constant, due to the fact we have friction between our feet

and the ground, if this attempted whilst standing in a small boat the result is very different, as we are now subject to the centrifugal
force of the bucket of water, but with no constant axis. This is in effect what the Sun is doing, except it has 9 planets spinning around

and many are huge compared to the Earth. The sun therefore, having no means of axis fixation, will move in its own orbit. This will vary
according to the alignment of the planets. The Sun will move in relation to the Earth, therefore producing warm periods and cool
periods. This occurs over many thousands of years, history tells us of ice ages. Sir Issac Newton figured this out with his 3rd Law of

Motion. This whole Zero Carbon Emission thing is whistling into the wind. The Govt should direct its energies and finances into things
it can change and benefit the population of New Zealand and not buy into the hysteria of the moment.
