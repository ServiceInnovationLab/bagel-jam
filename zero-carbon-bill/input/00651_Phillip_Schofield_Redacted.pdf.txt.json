Thanks for the opportunity to make a submission. Reducing NZ emissions is not hard but many simple changes are required to they

way we use soils and this will meet stern resistance from our agricultural experts who have spent their lives working in the modern
high tech agricultural production systems that ignore the need for healthy soil microbiology. The need to change the impact our

production has on the water, atmosphere, our livelihood and our health is evident and many progressive farmers are already making
big gains in soil health, water quality and soil carbon levels. They are doing this by ignoring the main stream advisors in the industrial

farming businesses and instead are nourishing their soil microbial workforce to cycle nutrients, build humus and improve their
productivity.
