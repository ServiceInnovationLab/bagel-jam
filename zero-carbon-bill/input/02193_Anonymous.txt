It is important that the zero carbon target is firmly embeded in our legislations. The biggest risk would be that a new incoming

government can water down the act in the futre. The experience we have had with the Emissions Trading Scheme should be a
reminder to us all that futuer governments may not agree with the bill or targets. The level to which these can be changed should

therefore be well defined within the legislation.
