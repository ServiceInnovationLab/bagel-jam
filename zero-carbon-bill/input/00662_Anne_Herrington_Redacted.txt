I only had time to read the summary and some sections where the questions pointed me to it. It is a very quick off the cuff
submission. I suggest that you include farming and business groups in your consultation as well as Iwi, social agencies etc. That is

make sure your consultation is far-reaching and the those groups are well represented by people who do have time to read the
document throughly.
