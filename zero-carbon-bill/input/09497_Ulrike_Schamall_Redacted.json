We as a nation have to make significant changes in all areas of our lifes. This issue can't be solved by any one group: industry,

transport, individuals. We're in it together. The biggest thing in my mind is a cultural shift to less consumerism (in all its forms) and
more community engagement and empathy. Only such a shift in individuals can successfully change behaviour of business and

Industrie. Governments can support such a culture shift through education, incentives and regulation/legislation.
