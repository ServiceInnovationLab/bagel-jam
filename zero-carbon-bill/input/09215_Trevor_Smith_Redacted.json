Climate change is a function of the geometry of our solar system. Our sun is not stationary. It swings 9 planets around, Jupiter and
Saturn many times bigger than Earth. By Newton's 3rd law there must be a reaction to that force, and that causes the sun into an

orbit of it's own. For all the planets to realign from any point in time, (that is for the sun to complete it's orbit) probably takes
thousands of years. So within this timescale the earth will be closer and further from the sun, creating Iceages and warm periods. We

are currently heading for a warm period. There is nothing we can do.
