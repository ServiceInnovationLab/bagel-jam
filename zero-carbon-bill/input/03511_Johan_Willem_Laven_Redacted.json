From my readings the assumption that climate warming is due entirely or mostly to carbon emissions is not sufficiently supported by

 the science. Yes, the conclusion that climate warming is due to human activity has been supported sufficiently to be accepted, but
 what human activity? I don't believe that the thinned ozone layer has been ruled out. The additional solar energy let into the
 atmosphere because of the thinned ozone layer appears to match quite closely the temperature increases. I am concerned that

 most people seem to treat 'climate change' as necessarily due to 'greenhouse gases' and indeed that most people conflate the two
 concepts. Weirdly, ozone is considered a greenhouse gas so the theory suggests we should get rid of the ozone layer. Ridiculous.
 Let's restore the ozone layer to historical quantity before imposing getting too carried away with reducing carbon. Charging people for

 carbon emission will be a den of corruption, the money going to unknown profiteers to little good end. There are other good reasons
 for reducing carbon and pollutant emissions but this can be achieved by promoting alternative energy industries. Taxing people who
 are largely trapped into the current circumstance is abusive. Provide alternatives.
