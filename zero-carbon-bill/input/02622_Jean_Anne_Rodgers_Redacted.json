Just to reiterate that our priorities need to change away from selfish consummerism and "jobs now" towards more life affirming ones,

caring for each other and looking after the environment for our children and grandchildren. To this end a universal basic income
would help to achieve equality and free people to do the environmental work that will need to be done.
