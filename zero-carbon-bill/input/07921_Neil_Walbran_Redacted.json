My key concern with the bill is the potential to lock in very high costs of ambitious leadership in climate change mitigation when the

effectiveness of our leadership is uncertain and the global benefits of more ambitious mitigation targets, should our leadership be
effective, is also uncertain. This is not to say we shouldn't do something, and some aspects of the bill, such as the climate change

commission and a strong emphasis on adaptation have strong merit. I would just like to see some flexibility to manage our future
commitments as new information comes to light.
