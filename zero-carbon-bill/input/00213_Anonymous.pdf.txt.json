Technological advances in gene editing and modification and improved significantly and need to be considered when looking at a 30
year pathway. Development of drought, flood and salt tolerant crops provides resilience and food security and if conducted effectively

will not be harmful to the NZ 'clean' brand. Crops that require less irrigation will improve water quality too. Of course we must look at
the risk vs opportunity in this space but I don't think it's wise for us to assume that depending on our clean image and brand is a sure

thing. We had this debate when margarine came out against butter. Social license must be considered but the scientific break
throughs in this field have huge potential and laws from 20 years ago today will be very old by 2050. This is something that shouldn't
be ignored. We must also consider the role of the ocean in this discussion. The oceansâ€™ play a major role in climate change (as a

carbon pump, and through heat storage). Focusing solely on carbon content in the atmosphere fails to integrate the whole earth
system.
