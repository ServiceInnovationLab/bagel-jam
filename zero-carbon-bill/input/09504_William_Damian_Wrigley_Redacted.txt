If the Zero Carbon Bill becomes law it will seek to chart NZ's course from its present level of carbon emissions to those considered
desirable and achievable by 2050. The circumstances that will prevail in 2050 are unknowable. It will be the function of interim

governments to continue to monitor the desirability and achievability of the 2050 target, NZ's progress towards achieving it ( or its
revised iteration), and its effects on NZ's citizens.
