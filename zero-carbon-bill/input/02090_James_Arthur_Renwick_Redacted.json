I am excited by the setting up of the Commission, and the zero-carbon bill. Done well, we have the opportunity to make a real
difference to the future of NZ and the world, in the face of the biggest challenge humanity has ever faced. I have just participated in

the first Lead Author meeting for the 6th Assessment Report of the IPCC, and I am reminded strongly of the stakes, the level of
commitment already at play, and the urgency of action.
