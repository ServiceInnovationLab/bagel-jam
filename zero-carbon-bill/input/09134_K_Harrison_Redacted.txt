New Zealand used to be a world leader in environmental management. We have the opportunity to do this again with an ambitious

climate change policy. NZ has the enviable position of already having a large portion of our electricity from renewable sources, making
the transition to Net Zero an easier reality than many other countries. Yes, we have high emissions from agriculture, but this provides

a unique opportunity to develop emission reduction technology and expertise that we can export around the world. Moreover, there
is clear evidence that industrial scale agriculture has adversely impacted our natural environment and tarnished our clean, green
image. Net Zero will see marginal land returned to forest, a much more sustainable alternative. Being an island nation at the mercy of

the weather and oceans Net Zero is also in our own self interest. Thank you for the opportunity to have my say. If any part of my
submission is published please only use my initial and surname (not my full name).
