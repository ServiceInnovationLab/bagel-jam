From my own personal experience I have seen the effects of climate change. We cannot put off taking decisive and strong action.

The government needs to take the lead and put policies and laws in place to make this happen. Meanwhile on a grassroots level
each person living in NZ needs to be committed to making and supporting the required changes. We do need to keep having these

conversations to get all of us heading in the same direction regarding climate change goals.
