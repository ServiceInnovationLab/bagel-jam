This is an urgent matter for the whole planet. We should be bold - make proper targets given the current scientific knowledge - and
work to the more pessimistic forecasts. Stop pandering to destructive industries (fossil fuel, animal farming). Make polices to help

those who will need to change how they work. Encourage the take-up of solar, wind power and electric cars; and encourage
innovation in these areas which can be used world-wide (business and education). Be a world leader on dealing with climate change.
