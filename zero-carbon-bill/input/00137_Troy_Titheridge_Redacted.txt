The plan should involve the stopping of importing second hand cars from Japan. Second hand car dealers are still importing cars from
the 90's and selling them to New Zealand buyers. If we are to achieve the targets, banning the import and sale of passenger cars to

New Zealand that are a certain age must be enacted. There should be guidelines that state for example that no car older than
2005(?) should be imported into New Zealand for sale as a passenger vehicle. In addition to this, providing incentives and tax breaks
for car dealerships that make a commitment to import 40% of cars are electric vehicles by 2025 will reduce carbon emissions to

reach the 2050 targets, gradually increasing the 45% to 60% by 2050.
