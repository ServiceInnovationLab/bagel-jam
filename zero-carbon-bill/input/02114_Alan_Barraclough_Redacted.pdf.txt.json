A just transition means that a monetary system for allocating emmissions to the rich based on their ability to pay is unjust. Just as rich

cant litter more than a poor person, nor should they be able to emit more as an individual. Therefore rationing systems rather than
auction systems should be put in place. Consideration should be given to the fact that it is the rich who have put the existing CO2 up

there in the atmosphere. It is clearly unjust that the poor equally pay to remove the CO2, and that the rich do not pay for the damage
ALREADY caused. We need to use our trading relationships to penalise or stop trade with countries which are not part of the Paris

agreement or are making no progress on reducing emmissions.
