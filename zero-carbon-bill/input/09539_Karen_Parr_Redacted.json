This Bill is an opportunity for New Zealand to take a stand internationally and demonstrate its commitment to stalling climate change.

A strong and committed stance will gain NZ international respect, and will also benefit the tourist industry, which, let's face it, may go
a long way to offsetting any resultant losses in the mining and agricultural sectors. The success of the Bill hinges on the

independence of the Climate Commission, and the fact that the effects are long-term, and legally binding to successive
governments. I believe that we should not underplay the influence and assistance we can provide for local (South Pacific) neighbours

with regard to climate change, and urge the legislators to view the Bill on a Pacific, not simply national, level. I believe there should be
flexibility in the role of the Commission to be expanded in the future to include, for example, assisting our neighbours to implement
similar measures, ocean clean-ups, reduction of solid waste, etc in the future. Wouldn't it be fantastic if the climate commissions of

countries such as NZ and the UK had international influence and could put pressure on less conscientious nations to follow our lead.
Please don't let us miss this opportunity to do the right thing, New Zealand. There will be economic effects, but the health of our

people and our planet has to come before profit.
