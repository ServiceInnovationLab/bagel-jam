This is an exciting piece of proposed legislation. We know there are significant and severe implications of anthropogenic climate

disruption. It would be fantastic to see New Zealand leading the way with an ambitious target with detailed and sensible plans to aid
us to meet that target. I am truly looking forward to this being passed - something for our country to be proud of as we take steps to

acknowledge what has happened and change the current trajectory.
