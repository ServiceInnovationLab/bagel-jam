Focus on the meat and diary industries - 49% of greenhouse gas emissions come from agriculture, according to the Ministry for the

 Environment (April 2018). I would like to see New Zealanders encouraged to reduce the amount of meat and dairy they consume,
 which would also improve general health. Farmers could be encouraged to diversify and focus more on sustainable, plant-based
 protein sources. Young farmers could be encouraged/incentivized to go into horticulture rather than agriculture.
