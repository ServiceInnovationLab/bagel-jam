Thank you for the opportunity to provide feedback. As outlined above, I would again like to highlight that the Zero Carbon Bill is a
unique opportunity to ensure that we contribute to a positive future in developing countries who are among the most vulnerable to

impacts such as changing weather patterns and sea level rise. As such, the Bill should include strong references to New Zealand's
international commitments under the Sustainable Development Goals and the Paris Agreement, notably Articles 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11 on

developed country support to developing countries, particularly in the area of adaptation. The Climate Commission could play a key
role in monitoring and strengthening our contributions in the global fight against climate change. A national adaptation plan could
include policy guidance on our adaptation support overseas. In short, please ensure the Zero Carbon Bill will not only drive

meaningful climate action at home but also across the developing world.
