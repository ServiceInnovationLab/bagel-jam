It doesn't take too much research to see that there is an entirely different and much more valid perspective by way of explanation for
any changes we may perceive occurring to our climate. I urge decision makers to investigate for themselves prior to making any
costly policy decisions. While there are many websites, documents, videos and other forms or media that I could upload or link, the

one I chose to attach called "Groupthink" is a good starting point. For goodness sake, read and absorb it. I do not wish my name to
be published.
