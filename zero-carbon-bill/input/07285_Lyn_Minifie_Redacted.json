Thank you for the opportunity to have some input. I feel strongly about global warming and that NZ can only benefit from taking a lead

globally in emission reduction. Short term costs will give long term advantage in to the future. I am a Nurse and am dismayed at the
short term view , and token gestures that hospitals take towards waste reduction. An example of this immoral approach to global

resources : single use stainless steel scissors and forceps which are imported from third world ? India, used once, then discarded. In
the past hospitals have had larger sterilisation services and good quality scissors etc have been autoclaved and reused. The
economics of this situation is immoral and happens in many areas of business- and points to reasons why we are in our current

environmental predicament
