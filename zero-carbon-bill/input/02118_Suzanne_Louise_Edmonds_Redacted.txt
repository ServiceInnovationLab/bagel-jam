Please note my answer to question 10. At present a lot (most) of the funding for agricultural mitigation and adaptation is coming from

the two big fertiliser companies, whose profit is being made from selling products which are ruining our soils, growing less pasture
than in the 1980s, and leaching hugely into our waters. Until someone is prepared to think outside this system, and fund testing for

what may well be natural alternatives, progress in agriculture will be painfully slow.
