In healthcare we know from studies that around 60% of our environmental impact and carbon footprint is from procurement. I am
almost certain that most households around the country are the same. It is easy to measure CO2e from our transport, energy etc -

these are the low lying fruits, but unfortunately only account for (at best) half of our emissions. Our clothes, chemicals, household
appliances, the things we consume of a daily basis without thinking probably make up the other half (or 2/3) of our true

environmental impact. As most of these things in NZ are imported from elsewhere but 'consumed' in NZ we need to make sure that
these are included in our calculations. I do not think currently that they are (other than perhaps their transport. This is depressing for
2 reasons. 1 - our job already seems daunting enough, the realisation that our CO2e is perhaps twice as large as we think makes the

task so much bigger. 2 measuring this is near impossible, it will require a full lifecycle analysis of all products imported to NZ. IF we are
serious about being truely carbon neutral rather that fudging the numbers on paper then this is what we NEED to do. We must

include healthcare in our calculations. Anaesthetic waste gasses make up a significant proportion of healthcare CO2e but are not
included in the government calculations. The anaesthetic gases from our 6 theirs last year were equivalent to the annual emissions

from 70 family cars... Finally I feel strongly that 'sustainability' is the key. sometimes focusing only on one strand of this (carbon
neutrality) can be detrimental to the environment in a number of other ways and NOT be sustainable. Geothermal electricity and its
impact of fresh water ways is a good example of this. We need to aggressively chase down our carbon targets but we also need to

focus on the wider issues of 'sustainability' for our country and our planet.
