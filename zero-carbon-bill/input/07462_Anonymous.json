We need to seriously consider that the vast majority of short lived gasses are coming from NZ agriculture. The consultation held on

the 4th July in Wellington referenced 'the evolution of technology' a lot and seemed to rely on this as our saviour. Sure, there will be
cleaner alternatives that can replace the comforts embedded into our current lifestyles - such as the electric car. This will be huge for
reducing the amount of carbon emission if we are to look at the ecological running cost of cars. It does not however take into

consideration the embodied emissions of a cars production, and how their accessibility (of having extremely low running costs) will
impact the way we use vehicles. It is likely that due to their availability, the amount of cars on the road will increase, along with their

use. So we've got to consider the surrounding infrastructure around alternative technologies and how they may contribute further
unsustainable habits.
