I strongly believe we need to set our targets, as a planet, for global warming to 1.5 degrees, not 2 degrees. 2 degrees is too warm for
many of our native species to survive. We need to lead this by example, in NZ, by setting bold zero emissions targets and achieving

this. This must be "set in stone", a piece of legislation that is not going to be overturned by different political parties being in
government, Our future depends on it. I am so excited our nation is working on this now, we have hope and can be an amazing

example to the rest of the world by doing this.
