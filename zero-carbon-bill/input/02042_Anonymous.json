How we globally respond to the challenge of climate change over the next 30 years will impact every person in the world for
centuries. I believe that our current path is a result of tremendous shortsightedness and an abrogation of our responsibility to future

generations and to those who are affected by climate change today. A strong Zero Carbon Bill would a be a key step towards New
Zealand doing what it needs to to ensure a hospitable planet both within my lifetime and in the future.
