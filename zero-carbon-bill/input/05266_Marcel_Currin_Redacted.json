Thinking about the wellbeing of my children and whatever grandchildren may follow, climate change is one of the issues I care about

most. Yet it's been hard for me to motivate myself to complete this submission. If I'm struggling to engage with something I claim to
be passionate about, how much harder will it be for other people to pay attention and make a submission? So, I would like to

acknowledge the difficulty that the government will have in bringing people on the journey through the tough decisions. Please make
sure you allocate sufficient ongoing budget to help tell the story about what we're doing as a nation, and why. A few years ago I wrote
some articles, published in the Bay of Plenty Times, about how we need to do whatever needs to be done to address climate

change. I've attached them as supporting documentation. They represent my view not as an expert, but as a layperson, a New
Zealander, a human, a citizen of the earth. I recall Bill English saying something like "I don't think most NZers wake up each morning
worrying about climate change." He's wrong. There are many, many people to whom this matters a great deal because we worry

about the future that our children and grandchildren will inherit. Thank you for making the first step with this bill.
