On a slightly related matter, in early July 2018, I submitted a proposal to the Hutt City Council for an improved method of rubbish

disposal. This could hugely reduce the amount of waste plastic and paper in the environment, while easing the load on landfills,
improving the quality of material sent to recycling and providing useful "boiler fuel". This would involve no major changes to the

existing arrangements, but would add a new option. The new option ("Project Orange") would nominally involve using pre-paid,
orange-coloured plastic bags for combustible, non-halogenated solid waste materials. Households and businesses would voluntarily

put all odds and sods of waste plastic (non-halogenated), paper, cardboard, small wood scraps etc into this bag, which would be
collected by the council in the normal collection. But instead of going to landfill or recycling, it would be used for thermal power
generation, industrial steam generation, heating of large buildings or simply burned off to dispose of it. By being burned usefully, this

could hugely decrease the escape of plastics into the sea, heavily reduce the load on landfills, and allow a small reduction in
consumption of coal, natural gas and/or biomass. (The last part would be good for decreasing carbon dioxide emissions by

decreasing the mining and use of fossil fuels).
