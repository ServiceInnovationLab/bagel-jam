I am a qualified New Zealand lawyer with a Masters Degree in Environmental and Energy Law from New York University. I am 27 years
old and will see substantial impacts of climate change in my lifetime. I think it is important that in addition to setting targets and plans,

New Zealand indicates its real present commitment to taking action on climate change, by introducing a functional price on carbon. A
Zero Carbon Act could be passed to include a set of current policies to help reduce emissions straight away, and the credibility of the

law would be boosted if we saw action being taken right away.
