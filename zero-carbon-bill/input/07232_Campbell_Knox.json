Only naive and scientifically destitute dilletantes believe in climate change. A good start is to work out the difference between
weather and climate.Weather is an incredibly complex and chaotic system controlled by the sun and sunspot activity,the tilt of the

earth's axis, the orbit around the sun and the earth's magnetic field to name but a few. Carbon is the building block of ALL life on
earth.CO2 levels have been triple what they are now at various times in history.Carbon greens the planet.There is NO scientific

evidence supporting climate change.Believers have been totally conned by Gore showing videos of melting icebergs.The Antarctic
ice sheet is increasing.The evidence is overwhelming and incontrovertible but evident only to those with the common sense and

acumen to drill down and discover it. Climate change? Prove it using evidence based scientific data,not videos of melting icebergs.
