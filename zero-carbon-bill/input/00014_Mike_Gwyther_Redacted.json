This has to happen now. Good to see a government willing to do something. Let's have the hard conversations now, then move on to
a brighter, cleaner, smarter future for all. PS consider the TOP policy on housing and wealth taxation. it's the only way to free up

people's finances from their homes, stop people being so scared of climate change destroying their equity, and will mean we have
more money to invest in new tech.
