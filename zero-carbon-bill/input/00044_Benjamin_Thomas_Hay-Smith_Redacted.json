At the end of the day, I think it's essential that we take some responsibility as a nation for our emissions. Reaching the target of net
zero emissions by 2050 is an important part of this process, and it seems obvious to me that our progress on this issue should be as

removed from politics as possible. The more we allow politicians to discuss the nature and threat of climate change and its
associated problems, the less actual work is being done to address them. In the perfect world, reaching our target of net zero
emissions by 2050 would be a 'set and forget' matter. At least then people would be able to rest easy knowing that real action is

being taken, by professionals, to guide our country into a future where we still have a habitable planet for our children and
grandchildren.
