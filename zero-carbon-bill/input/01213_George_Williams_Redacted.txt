Can someone please explain why pastoral farming is implicated as a contributor to net emissions when in fact it is a carbon neutral

 and natural part of the carbon cycle? All forage consumed by grazing herbivores fixes CO2 from the atmosphere and part of this
 captured carbon is returned to the atmosphere as a result of the digestive process in the form of methane, a short lived gas as
 compared to CO2. Part of the consumed forage carbon is retained by the soil as pasture litter breaks down and part is retained by the
 animal as it grows bone and muscle tissue, wool or dairy product. It could therefore be argued that pastoral farming is better than

 carbon neutral and should be lauded as a carbon credit industry rather than a net polluter. If the argument is pursued that pastoral
 farming is a carbon emitter then consideration needs to given to "where did that carbon come from?"
