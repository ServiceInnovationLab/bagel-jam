The alleged detrimental effect of CO2 has been misunderstood. Over the past 30 years, an area the size of a continent has greened

(just think of the additional oxygen that has been generated from photosynthesis). No account is taken of that for farmers in NZ, who
grow grass to feed their stock. It is a closed cycle as stock emissions are offset by sequestered CO2.
