Would prefer to not have my name published on the website. Also, focusing on emissions is the wrong area of focus on the
environment. The primary focus should be on water and land, rather than the air. But as long as this is not at the expense of efforts to

improve our waterways, build toilets, prevent the spread of disease that is killing our natives etc. is fine. Decisions impacting NZ
should be do holistically. e.g. stopping extraction of resources, will overall the environment be better, or will we just import more of
things that harm the environment. Consult departments and parties that the changes will hurt. The Taranaki oil fiasco is not the way

to go, not consulting departments or the industry until the decision had already been made.
