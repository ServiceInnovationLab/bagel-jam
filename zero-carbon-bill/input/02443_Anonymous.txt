I'd like to see a few things: 1. Coal fire plants shutdown as of now (both power and other uses). Including Huntly, including Fonterra

milk drying plants! 2. Wood fire heating systems removed. No new should be sold. (winter emissions are caused by those) 3. Coal
burner heating systems removed. 4. Our current buses by no means reduce emissions. They are both extremely dirty both inside the

bus (you can smell the gases inside) and outside. Can't see how they are better than me riding in a self driving electric car (which is
probably done deal in 1-2 years). 5. I sincerely think that leading the way will do good for the planet and for our economy, the

technology solutions we are going to create is going to create far better GDP growth than predicted. 6. Regarding electricity markets
make a very simple change like Germany did: renewable energy takes priority. Renewable excludes bio energy, which has harmful
emissions. Consider that only solar and wind are 0 emission. Both geothermal and hydro are NOT 0 emission, there is no direct

emssions, though secondary emissions from biological processes (eg. bio build up in front of dams) need to be considered. Feel free
to contact me for pointers, but you'll find this in the scientific literature. 7. Take examples from Germany, they are leading the way of

transformation. 8. Develop an increased market incentive to promote electric cars.
