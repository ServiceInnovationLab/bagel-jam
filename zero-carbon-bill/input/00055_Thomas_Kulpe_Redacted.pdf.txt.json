Carbon sequestration by planting trees (even permanent forests) is not sustainable, we will quickly run out of land. The idea that it will

buy us time until new technologies come on stream is suicidal if these technologies don't emerge. The low emission economy must
be the priority. Let's include in our GHG budget emissions from air and sea transport to/from NZ and start looking how we can reduce

emissions created by tourism and the livestock industry.
