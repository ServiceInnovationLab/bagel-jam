It is time for New Zealand to lead again. We have a history of global leadership: we were the first country to give women the vote and

the first to become nuclear free. It is time to take another giant step towards climate justice globally. New Zealand has demonstrated
global leadership with our commitment to stopping oil and gas exploration â€“ now let us continue that moral leadership and include

transparency in what and how we support climate change efforts abroad.
