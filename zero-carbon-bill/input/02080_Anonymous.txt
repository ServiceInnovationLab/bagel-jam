NZ could be a world leader in adapting to climate change. We could be implementing solar panels on all public buildings, reducing our

power need nationwide, we could be investing in public transport in our cities, making cars an unaffordable luxury. We could improve
working conditions so those who could work from home, do so, reducing the need for a daily commute. The greening of public

buildings and open spaces would mitigate our pollution, the improvement in our recycling would reduce our need for new raw
materials. We need to become more self-sufficient, Community gardens a must-have, fruit trees grown in public spaces,
encouragement of vegetable gardens for all who want to grow their own.
