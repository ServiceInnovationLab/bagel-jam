The Paris agreement is a shame on humans. It is unfortunately needed because we are unable to make ourselves do what is

necessary without others being made to do the same. We have all created this situation and must all respond to trying to mitigate
some of it. The government must react more urgently than it is doing at present regardless of what any previous government did to

make things more difficult now. At present Regional Councils are granting consents which are negating any efforts to mitigate climate
change. There should be a moratorium on all consents now. In the Edgecumbe Flood of 2017 I lost my family home of 30 years. The
Council has taken over my property to repair the breached stopbank and reposition a roadway but is negating any works it does by

granting consents which will produce more green house gas. Don't spend so much time on the bureaucracy that we make the
situation worse and are then less able to do something about it.
