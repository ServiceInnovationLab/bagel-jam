Please can we have the best cross-party consensus here but please can we be guided by science and objectivity and not by self
interest or short term economic concerns. We are all going to have to change. We are all going to have to make some sacrifices and

suffer some short term losses perhaps. if we are smart, swift and innovative we can actually profit substantially, both in terms of a
healthy safe future and a booming carbon negative economy. Yes, carbon negative. We can help ourselves and others here and we

must try.
