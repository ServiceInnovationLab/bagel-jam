As entomologist working independently in the Far North of New Zealand I have been monitoring insects in the warmest part of New

Zealand since 1999. Insects are regulated by temperature so are ideal indicators of climate change. I can report that since its arrival
in 1999 the Tropical grass webworm, Herpetogramma licasisalis, has not spread further south of Kaitaia, despite its food source

kikuyu grass extending throughout Northland as far south as coastal Horowhenua. As its name suggests this is a tropical insect
which is at the limit of its distribution in New Zealand north of Kaitaia. In 20 years climate has not warmed sufficiently for this insect to

extend its range (Dymock et al. 2009. Proceedings of the New Zealand Grasslands Association 71: 25-30). I am currently working on
distribution changes of a range of key insect indicators of climate change.
