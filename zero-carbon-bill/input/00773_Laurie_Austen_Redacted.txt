The highlighting of Climate Change appears to continually focus on the Polar Ice Caps and I believe a large number of People do not

 readily associate themselves with anything beyond their back door. In the course of exploring the reasons for depletion of Toheroa on
 Ninety Mile Beach I discovered that in response to a relatively small increase in Temperature over the last sixty Years our Climate has
 undergone a massive change with a complete reversal in Previously Prevailing Winds . This Change is part of a global influence but
 there is a good chance that Toheroa is the disappearing Canary in the Coal Mine and the indicator for the next Native Species unable

 to adapt to the speed of Climate Change The factors causing the reversal of our Winds and the tropicalisation are not if ever exposed
 but are an example of powerful Change Here Today.
