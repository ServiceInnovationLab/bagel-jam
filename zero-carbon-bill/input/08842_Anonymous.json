The Zero Carbon Bill does not consider, recognise or encourage any carbon capture methods other than growing trees. This is very
short-sighted and limiting what is possible to achieve. If we give carbon/greenhouse gases a sufficiently high price then CCS

solutions become viable. No consideration is given to influencing consumption behaviour (other than carbon pricing) when
alternatives exist. Why do we fail to learn from watching what works or fails in other countries?, Successful consumption levers include
e.g. tax the use of cars with engines >2 litres as they do in northern Europe and that changes behaviour and reduces consumption

dramatically. Encourage electric car uptake by using tax incentives (such as no GST) or rebates and subsidising electricity (works in
California and Norway). New Zealand has very expensive electricity at the domestic consumer level and something needs to done to

bring this into line with other OECD countries, i.e. bring it down so we can afford to use electricity to replace wood/biomass, coal, oil
and gas where possible. Also our electricity infrastructure will be strained if the proposed uptake of electricity conversions is even

partially achieved - where will the money for the required upgrades come from?
