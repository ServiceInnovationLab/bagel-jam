Household and community scale forest gardens and food forests can provide a decentralised solution to provide food and resources

to New Zealanders while also sinking carbon, reducing food miles and freeing land from industrial food production allowing it to be
returned to native forest cover (further sinking carbon and helping stabilise New Zealand's climate).
