In my opinion, their should be a mechanism that regularly checks on the progress of other comparable countries with similar goals, to
assess whether they have any new data or expertise that could assist us to achieve our own goals. This could involve two-way
information sharing/cooperation agreements, if not already in place. Additionally, a robust set of mechanisms should be laid out which

will fully 'air-gap' those who create, enforce, and are directly subject to Zero Carbon Bill policies from the influences of stakeholders
who are recognised as having a vested interest in delaying, degrading or obstructing effective climate change policy. I.e. no more

industry-led cooperation which simply allows companies to hollow out climate policy under the guise of stakeholder engagement,
and no Cambridge Analytica style influence campaigning by industry groups or individuals to dupe voters or economic sectors into

degrading the Zero Carbon Bill or carbon budgets. As a final note, out of left field, I think that education about food in our schools
should be made more robust and prominent in the curriculum, with more knowledge provided to students about how their eating
decisions may affect their environment, and practical kitchen skills which genuinely empower them to not only have strong control

over how their diet effects their environment, but their health and well-being as well.
