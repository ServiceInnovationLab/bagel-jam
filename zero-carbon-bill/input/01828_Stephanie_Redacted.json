I am seriously concerned about the environmental damage being caused by things like deforestation and intensive farming. Things
like deforestation are actually causing weather pattern changes which are impacting us more than emissions. Also, we need to keep
a calm approach to things - extreme weather events are part of the history of our planet and not necessarily caused by emissions.
