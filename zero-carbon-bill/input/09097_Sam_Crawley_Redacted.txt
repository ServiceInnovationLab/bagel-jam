Although a net zero target by 2050 is ambitious, it is likely to be insufficient to avoid even 2 degrees warming (even assuming all the
world's major emitters do the same). Recent research has shown that global emissions must peak by no later than 2030 to have a

reasonable chance of staying below 2 degrees (https://eciu.net/assets/peak-emissions/), and even this assumes negative
emissions will occur on a large scale later this century. Given this reality of the situation, it is worth considering an even more

ambitious target: net zero by 2040.
