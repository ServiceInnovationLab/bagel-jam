Let's be a shining beacon of best practice and forward thinking. NZ people are known for their creative and practical problem solving
skills - let's use those skills to the best of our ability.
The environment is our most precious gift, we must preserve it.
I am a New Zealand citizen extremely concerned with New Zealand's lack of action and side stepping on climate change to date. I am
thankful to finally see climate change addressed in a holistic way and commend all those involved in making this happen.
Climate change needs to be taken seriously, the changes we need to make are drastic and it is important that the government gives
clear leadership on this. These changes will not be easy so there needs to be a clear path to zero.




 
not only is it crucial for organisations to be held accountable for their exposure, but people should be given the information they
require to make informed decisions on how their interaction with companies could impact our global environment




 
Proud to be a Kiwi with the Zero Carbon Bill/Act guiding our future
This has to happen now. Good to see a government willing to do something. Let's have the hard conversations now, then move on to
a brighter, cleaner, smarter future for all. PS consider the TOP policy on housing and wealth taxation. it's the only way to free up

people's finances from their homes, stop people being so scared of climate change destroying their equity, and will mean we have
more money to invest in new tech.
Thank you for this initiative. I don't know of another country showing this leadership and preparation. The temptation is to say 'oh, NZ

is small we can't make a difference' - but leadership like this can ring around the world.
I think this is a fantastic and well researched document which makes an important first step. Congratulations! In order for this to be of

maximum benefit - we need to ensure a high proportion of NZ people engage with it. This requires a lot of targeted marketing - This
needs a very strong Stakeholder and Communications Management Strategy. A great job and well done . I would welcome any further
discussions on the subject
Just want to give some feedback on the legislative changes to support climate change relating to electric vehicles. You might be
 aware of the issues around electric car batteries at present. I have just bought a Nissan Leaf, and am aware that there are no

 batteries presently being imported into the country because the current laws classify them as a dangerous substance. They are
however allowed to be imported when they are inside a car. The lack of replacement batteries is putting a lot of people off buying

Leafs which are all used Japanese imports, particularly the older ones which have less reliable batteries that will need replacement.
We need to change the legislation as soon as possible to support the safe import of refurbished batteries from Japan for our electric

cars. We also need to incentivise car manufacturers to produce batteries in NZ, and support NZ companies that are trying to replicate
these batteries and produce them at home. I hope we can also support the mining of substances used by car batteries that we

currently have available to be mined in NZ, in an environmentally friendly way, and sell these substances or use to develop our own
EV battery industry in NZ. they are in big demand around the world.
This bill is important for our future, I hope you'll make it work. Re my data sharing consent... I'm happy for my submission to be put on

your website, but please remove my name and email from it. Online privacy is a bit of a concern these days. Thank you.




 
Time is of the essence. Targets need to be bolder. Have some guts.
Collaboration among different agencies is essential.
Don't buckle on this issue. It's vitally important, but also a huge opportunity.




 
The current system is fine and does not need to be changed
It is of paramount importance that the soils role be recognised in this issue in order to encourage farming practice to increase the
soils organic matter. "A great deal of the carbon once stored in the soil is now stored in the atmosphere - 30% of CO2 can be

countered by humus-building (based upon just the top 15cm)" Graeme Saite . Humus Saves the World, Ted Talk. Moreover it has
been estimated that a 1% increase in US crop lands alone would take take 4.5 billion tonnes of CO2 from the atmosphere and return

it to the soil. Recognition of this principle and applied to NZ will have huge benefit to the proposed Carbon budgets.
Althought this bill has a lot of promise, I believe it imperative that we put safeguards in place to stop a change in government or

progress to reverse the power it has. Also - the ETS is broken, why keep it?
It is important that we stay focused on the goal of Zero Carbon New Zealand, we are doing changes today that will effect our future
children and environment.




 
The document lacks specific ideas of exactly how to reduce emissions. Target setting is OK but then we need to discuss exactly how
we will meet those targets.
survival of our species and other appropriate species from our world government needs to work with the humans the serve.
The commission must be independent, lack conflicts of interest (business interests that is), have the authority to set new rules and
targets and enforce them if there is inaction on behalf of govt. It must be as transparent as possible, work on behalf of people and

not profit and have the spine to stand up to powerful business interests that have vested interests that conflict with the health of the
environment. There also needs to be a lot more focus on agriculture and their impact on the environment. They are the single largest

contributor to greenhouse gasses and have done immense damage to our environment. They need to be held responsible and
must adapt to the changes that must be made to save our environment




 
At the end of the day, I think it's essential that we take some responsibility as a nation for our emissions. Reaching the target of net
zero emissions by 2050 is an important part of this process, and it seems obvious to me that our progress on this issue should be as

removed from politics as possible. The more we allow politicians to discuss the nature and threat of climate change and its
associated problems, the less actual work is being done to address them. In the perfect world, reaching our target of net zero
emissions by 2050 would be a 'set and forget' matter. At least then people would be able to rest easy knowing that real action is

being taken, by professionals, to guide our country into a future where we still have a habitable planet for our children and
grandchildren.
Education and changing the growth paradigm is key to addressing climate change effectively. NZ should be leading the world, along

with other progressive nations, and a massive international publicity campaign should be implemented.
Submission for the Zero Carbon Act Starting with the low hanging fruit is a good way to make rapid progress towards the Zero Carbon
Goal. Much carbon entering the atmosphere as CO2 comes from fossil fuels used by petrol and diesel fueled vehicles for transport

services in our economy. But now, with the arrival of electric vehicles that are already practical substitutes for transport of all types, a
transition which has already started, can be accelerated by such a Zero Carbon Act and so will dramatically reduce fossil carbon

entering our atmosphere. I would like to suggest that a complete transition to an all-electric economy could be achieved in say ten
years with appropriate Government Aid and Encouragement. Should such a transition be successful, other ongoing benefits to our
society would be the elimination of N20, a long-lived greenhouse gas from exhaust pipes, along with smoke and other PM 2.5

particles believed to be causing the ill health and early deaths of the public at large. Indeed, there would be no exhaust pipes and
NZ’s contribution to global warming would be greatly and rapidly reduced. The need for speedy action can be seen all around the

world, not just in NZ. The trajectory of global temperature curves, CO2 and Methane concentrations, all are accelerating upwards, an
ice-free Arctic is a real possibility even next Arctic Summer, and Antarctic ice is dwindling. Greenland is losing ice and sea level rise is

increasing. Why would we wait to act? In the background the very real possibility of positive feed backs such as where warming
destabilises massive stores of Arctic methane clathrates to release methane, which in turn reinforces the warming rate to release yet

more methane in an accelerating self-perpetuating reaction. There is the potential for very rapid and massive increases in the current
warming being seen. A further benefit that would accrue from a rapid transition to all- electric transport comes from the fact that if
Solar Energy is used to replace the energy formally supplied by burning fossil fuels for transport purposes, then the costs of that

energy and quantity of that energy is significantly less than the costs of those previously used fuels. Here it is assumed that solar
energy would be generated in a distributed manner wherever that energy is being used to charge electric vehicles, usually in garages

attached to domestic dwellings or business enterprises. ( See Vector for the feasibility of using Distributed Generators without
causing grid disruption). This leads to an estimate on a per household level of benefit from not buying petrol and diesel of $2,951 and

$5,348 per annum respectively. Once installed and paid for the solar panels will continue to deliver power for up to at least 30 years.
Payback times are 2.58 years and 5.32 years respectively. In total an additional 48 Billion dollars would circulate in our economy
annually, and this figure does not include the costs of ill health and early death, and accelerating climate change avoided. I would like

to share the spreadsheet that I created for interested parties to understand how the benefits mentioned above were calculated. Of
course, the results depend on current costs and prices that can change in the future, but these are inputs that can be changed on

the spreadsheet at any time to reveal new results. I was unsuccessful in attaching a copy to the first submission I attempted, so will
send a working copy to anybody making a request by email to me at
Some of the answers above are 'yes, but'. Therefore in some cases I've ticked the 'not specified' box.
Carbon sequestration by planting trees (even permanent forests) is not sustainable, we will quickly run out of land. The idea that it will

buy us time until new technologies come on stream is suicidal if these technologies don't emerge. The low emission economy must
be the priority. Let's include in our GHG budget emissions from air and sea transport to/from NZ and start looking how we can reduce

emissions created by tourism and the livestock industry.
I am not impressed that low income household hit the hardest under the current proposal should not be affected due limit on income
 as no need to impose like this. Low income household should be able to request right to exemptions if hardship become evidently.
 Not without consultation with low Income communities first.
My degree from the University of California was in environmental sciences. In my opinion, the entire climate change hysteria is driven
 by two factors. One, the generous government grants given to scientists acting as prostitutes. Two, politicians jumping on the
 bandwagon to secure votes. The earth is now in an 800 year warming cycle, interrupted briefly by global cooling during the post WWII
 industrial boom. The causes of global warming and the increase of CO2 are not related to the kinds of human activity usually
 mentioned. It is totally irresponsible for the New Zealand government to throw wrenches into the NZ economy in the name of zero

 carbon emissions.
This is far less important than acting to reduce emissions
I am immensely pleased to see this incredibly important legislation taking shape, and I wish to thank the Minister and MfE for their

hard work.
Back to question 3. Planting trees on farms seems to me like a simple but effective option. We already have technology like drones

and mapping software. This will find the most effective places to plant trees to reduce erosion. It will create jobs in the region's.
Planting navites will create habitat for native species. Location is also a big part in what should be planted. I believe forestry should

only be planted a certain distant up river from the ocean. Otherwise heavy regulations on what happens with all the slash and off cuts.



 
The rest of the world is polluting little NZ is only a drop in the ocean the problem is there are to many humans in the world and every
second there are more arriving so we are pushing crap uphill. It's to late !
I applaud the comprehensive approach to tackling this issue. There are some hard times ahead for some sectors and for many

whānau, but we must still tackle the bigger issues and support those who will take the brunt of the transformation.




 
We need focus and contestable reporting.
Regarding clean Power Generation: Government could buy, say 100000 solar power systems in China and selling with a small profit

(to cover the interest/ opportunity cost) to residents. Germany is producing 15-20% of power generated from solar systems on
houses-,barns-, company- roofs. Why can we not with more sunshine in NZ? Regarding "clean" Economy: We could establish thriving
Kur House Centers in Northland (expanding to alternative treatment, health tourism). All it needs is the expertise (can get a Kur-

Doctor from Europe and Physiotherapist), fresh air and water. This is not available in New Zealand, but in Germany there a hundreds
of Kur-cities/ villages (called Bad/ Bath-cityname) providing these health services (degenerative disease, stress related dysfunctions

etc), particularly in areas with no income from industries (North Sea Coast and Bavaria). The "patients" live in private accommodations
(quality assured!) providing income for the population, also need small group tramping guides (lots of walking, cycling). The city is

charging a Kur-tax per night to provide some services and beautifying the city/village. I can provide more information if requested.
Cows may be polluting our rivers, but animal agriculture has not contributed to any of the increase in atmospheric methane for at
 least 10 years, Increases have instead been due to fracking, rice growing, and landfill. decomposition. Meat and dairy are far more

 nutritious than rice, landfill, or fracking. We should control the state of our rivers, but not stress too much about animals burping.
Constantly growing and photosynthesising pasture should be used as an offset. Current emission calculations are fraudulent.
The climate change goals need to understand the underlying reason for pressure on the environment. We have an event based on

primary production. On concert with this bill needs to be national leadership on changing our economy to one that does not require
potentially polluting industry.
Need to ensure we do not miss the renewables potential,quick growing hemp industry for sustainable building and other,plastic
recycling for road fabrication and building etc. ,water recycling
the fact that we are creating a Zero Carbon Bill is a great start to a bright future or New Zealand, but we should not act on the climate
halfheartedly. the positive changes need to happen fast, be bold and be effective. We cannot sit around discussing options of what to

do while the climate changes past the point we cannot correct it.



 
New Zealand has long been considered a kind of political avant-garde and social laboratory of the world. Climate change offers a
prime opportunity to reclaim this position. Please be ambitious.




 
It is such a huge relief to have a government that is taking climate change seriously.
I want the government to sort out all supermarkets and this has to start now no more plastic bags full stop. fruit and veg areas need

to have paper bags. how come I can buy two 500g margarine cheaper than 1000g how stupid when I was young buying in bulk was
always cheaper bring this back ..... less packets most people around Hawera don't care about using reusable even when they have

seen the state of our oceans its disgusting if they cant change their wicked ways they will have to put their groceries from trolley to
car one at time .we also have serial litters just go to our lovely parks sports grounds and streets bastard people leave takeaway
packets everywhere. there needs to heavy fines for them . I rang the police once they don't police litters and told me to go to the

council . even the council don't care
Why no EV tax back or subsidy?




 
New Zealand needs to act on climate change mitigation on the assumption that the countries of the world will achieve their Paris
commitments. This essential if we are to avoid setting plans that are unrealistic in relation to what the rest of the world is doing. NZ

can continue to emit reasonably large amounts of green house gases for a lengthy period of time because of the scope to plant large
areas of trees as offsets. Very few other countries are in this happy situation so will in fact have to reduce their gross emissions very

dramatically to achieve net zero emissions. As a simple example NZ could achieve net zero by reducing gross emissions from the
present 18/19 tonnes per capita to, say, 10 tonnes and offset the remaining 10 tonnes for many years. China currently emits 5
tonnes per capita but has no chance of offsetting more than a tonne or two per capita even in the short term. Most countries are

much closer to the China example than the NZ example so NZ must plan to fit into a world that is much more constrained in its ability
to produce the goods that NZ currently imports or plans to import in the future. It is all well and good to plan on replacing ICE private

vehicles with EV private vehicles as part of our plan but where are we going to import them from if other countries have higher
priorities (feeding, clothing, housing, heating and transporting their citizens) than producing goods to export to NZ? Although plans

that take account of these issues will be more disruptive of NZ society, they will be manageable provided we are doing the planning
rather than suddenly discovering that the rest of the world is pursuing actions that make our too self-centred plans ineffective. The

essential barrier to taking effective action to reduce NZ's emissions is the reluctance of the current generation to decide on and then
make the sacrifices of elements of their high consumption way of life regardless of how much this refusal will damage the lives of
future generations. Understanding this strong psychological commitment to a way of life that is unsustainable in anything except the

very short term must be the starting point for any planning of mitigation action. Accepting the fundamental importance of the
psychology in making changes must be taken on board yet this discussion ignores it completely. The ethical need for the current

generation to take account of the enormous damage being done to future generations is overwhelmed by our commitment to the
high consumption life style even though this often requires people to hold mutually inconsistent beliefs.
This is an important first step for the government to be undertaking, regardless of whether it actually ends-up a success. We have

got to try.
The government should set a 2025 Target Policy and legislation should be introduced within 6 months.
Just slow down and think about what you're doing here. NZ is contributing stuff all to the global situation.
It seems the NZ Public have no idea what the impacts are for the change. The speed with which MFE are rolling out the review plans

exceeds the ability for NZ Inc to respond. NZ MFE need to make better consideration of the requirements for 'change management.'
The web site has far too many documents for the average person to fathom and read. The Climate document referred to in this
survey could not be found. The impact likely impact changes, indirectly form a tax. These new taxes are likely to surprise NZ Inc.
I applaud the considered and progressive approach to economic transformation that this Bill is a part of.
Would prefer to not have my name published on the website. Also, focusing on emissions is the wrong area of focus on the
environment. The primary focus should be on water and land, rather than the air. But as long as this is not at the expense of efforts to

improve our waterways, build toilets, prevent the spread of disease that is killing our natives etc. is fine. Decisions impacting NZ
should be do holistically. e.g. stopping extraction of resources, will overall the environment be better, or will we just import more of
things that harm the environment. Consult departments and parties that the changes will hurt. The Taranaki oil fiasco is not the way

to go, not consulting departments or the industry until the decision had already been made.
The document for you provided for us is too long and wordy and makes it difficult to do the reading necessary to answer this survey
properly.
There is sufficient expertise in NZ to make this a reality, however business has so far managed to sideline the Climate Change
mitigators and it is essential that a power shift is initiated.
Здравствуйте. Я не являюсь гражданином вашей прекрасной страны - Новая Зеландия. Проблема же, которую хочет
решить ваша страна - это проблема всех жителей нашей планеты. Большая благодарность за это Министерству

окружающей среды, правительству и хочу высказать своё мнение по поводу Закона о нулевом углероде, если
предоставляется такая возможность. Все понимают, что необходимо немедленно предпринимать конкретные меры для

защиты окружающей среды и экологии, но в основном же загрязняют природу не простые люди, а всевозможные
предприятия. Закон о новом углероде во многом касается и энергетики. Почему бы не создать для компаний и
корпораций, работающих в сфере энергетики такие льготные условия, чтобы они сами стремились искать и внедрять

новые направления и новые технологии в "зелёной" энергетике. Чтобы у этих корпораций был стимул и они не теряли
прибыли, а в перспективе им это было выгодно. Кстати, об одном из новых направлений в "зелёной" энергетике я Вам

писал и предлагал новую технологию. Предлагаемая мною инновация особенно подходит для компаний работающих в
сфере гидроэнергетики, так как разработана и обоснована на примере турбогенераторов мощностью 10 Мегаватт и

выше. Возможно моё письмо не приняли всерьёз или оно попало в СПАМ, а может трудности с переводом с русского на
английский. Я не хочу, чтобы моё имя было включено в любое резюме материалов, которые могут быть опубликованы
министерством. С уважением, Юрий Александрович.

Hello.

I received a signature of the 30th day of the content, which became clear that the title of the bill was
drafted by the Nu- clear Carbon and the correspondence with the Wamakakim, and lost to failure. I

also wrote to you that you would like to support the Law Project on the Nu- clear Carbon Concrete
Proposal. This is a new technology for the production of ecologically clean electric energy, which is
ideal for the Law on Nile Carbon. Owing to this innovation, the objectives are the same as those set
by the Ministry of the Environment and the Government of your country.

Probably, the most rightful is to write down the content of your proposal, and you need to follow

the instructions.

The proposed technology is a technical solution and can be attributed to the hydropower industry,
so it is designed and justified on the basis of registration of units with capacity of 10 megawatts. The
hydraulic units will be driven by additional equipment. To work on additional equipment, it is

necessary to install diesel generators to bring electricity and other sources. The proposed technology
for tope-stepping is a new direction in "green" energy.

<Opportunities and advantages of power plants built on the basis of a given method.>

    1. a) Hydrocarbons are required in a small amount and only for the work of a diesel generator.
        B) Petroleum products, coal or gas are consumed if additional power is supplied to the

        electric power supply for a source of electricity. In this variant, the electric power
        consumption for additional equipment is approximately 10% of the amount of electricity
        that will be produced by the hydro turbine.

    2. Hydroagregaty and additional equipment are in the room, which makes the work of the
        power plant independent of weather conditions. Therefore, it providesstable equipment, as
        well as convenient operation, maintenance and repair equipment.

    3. Harmful emissions and the greenhouse effect are minimal or absent.
    4. Electric power stations with the necessary power may be built in almost any room near the
        enterprise, the city. Therefore, expensive expenditures for construction and operation of the
        electric power transmission to the consumer (LEP) are insignificant.

    5. These power plants will occupy a small area, can be built in remote and isolated areas, and
        can also be autonomous.
    6. Companies that work in the field of energy and have similar technology can build such

        electric power plants in any country. Everywhere possible all possible resources-suitable
        rivers, sunlight, hydrocarbons. This technology solves the problems of modern energy,
        protecting the environment and ecology, and benefits from these companies to the

        competitors.
    7. The implementation of these technologies in the industry and its commercialization will not
        create difficulties for companies working in the field of energy. The advantage and simplicity

        of this is that it develops justified standard hydraulic turbines and standard additional
        equipment that work long hours in the world.
Sincerely,

P.S. I would be most grateful if you answered the request.

   Здравствуйте.
Получил Ваше письмо 30 июня из содержания которого стало понятно, что моя заявка на Законопроект о
Нулевом Углероде и переписка с Вами каким-то образом затерялись или остались без внимания. Моя заявка

была отправлена в Министерство окружающей среды в начале июня и номер заявки №128. Ещё я писал Вам, что
хотел бы поддержать Законопроект о Нулевом Углероде конкретным предложением - Это новая технология
производства экологически чистой электроэнергии, которая идеально подходит для Закона о Нулевом Углероде.
Благодаря этой инновации во многом решаются задачи поставленные Министерством окружающей среды и
правительством вашей страны.

Наверное, самое правильное - это снова написать содержание моего предложения, а Вы уж сами решайте
подходит оно Вам или нет.

Предлагаемая технология - это техническое решение и его можно отнести к гидроэнергетике, так как оно

разработано и обосновано на примере гидроагрегатов мощностью 10 Мегаватт и выше. Гидроагрегаты будут
приводиться в действие с помощью дополнительного оборудования. Для работы дополнительного оборудования
необходимо установить дизель-генератор или подвести электроэнергию из другого источника. Предлагаемая
технология в какой-то степени является новым направлением в "зелёной" энергетике.


< Возможности и достоинства электростанций построенных на основании данного способа. >
1. а) Углеводороды требуются в незначительном количестве и только для работы дизель-генератора.
б) Нефтепродукты, уголь или газ не требуются, если для работы дополнительного оборудования электроэнергия
подводится из другого источника. В этом варианте расход электроэнергии на работу дополнительного
оборудования составляет примерно 10% от количества электроэнергии, которую будет вырабатывать

гидротурбина.

2. Гидроагрегаты и дополнительное оборудование монтируются в помещении, что делает работу электростанции
независимой от погодных условий. Благодаря этому обеспечивается стабильная работа оборудования, а также
удобная эксплуатация, обслуживание и ремонт оборудования.


3. Вредные выбросы и парниковый эффект минимальны или отсутствуют.

4. Электростанции необходимой мощности могут быть построены практически в любом месте - вблизи

предприятия, города. Благодаря этому, дорогостоящие расходы на строительство и эксплуатацию линий
передачи электроэнергии потребителю (ЛЭП) незначительны.

5. Эти электростанции будут занимать небольшую территорию, могут быть построены в отдалённых и
изолированных районах, а также могут быть автономными.


6. Компании, работающие в сфере энергетики и имеющие подобную технологию, могут строить такие
электростанции в любой стране. Даже бедной всевозможными ресурсами - подходящими реками, солнцем и
ветром, углеводородами. Эта технология во многом решает проблемы современной энергетики, защите
окружающей среды и экологии и даёт преимущество этим компаниям перед конкурентами.


7. Внедрение этой технологии в промышленность и её коммерциализация не составит затруднений для
компаний и специалистов, работающих в сфере энергетики. Достоинство и простота этого способа в том, что он
разработан и обоснован на стандартных гидротурбинах и стандартном дополнительном оборудовании, которые
давно работают во всём мире.


С уважением,                       .
P.S. Буду признателен за ответ на моё письмо-запрос Вам.
Yes. We are not doing enough, and the Paris agreement is not nearly enough either. We need a carbon tax, we need electric cars to
be cheaper and we need stricter run off targets for dairy farms. I mean, come on. You’re letting 15,000 dairy cows in the Mackenzie’s

country on acrid soil? On the shores of the clearest lake in our country. This is a joke. This country needs to step up and do
something tangible and world leading in fighting climate change. Or people of my generation will be left to clean it up. And my kids will

have to clean it up too with maybe irreversible damage to our climate.
Thank you for the opportunity to participate to this process. As a last word, I hope that although we're a small country in size, we'll be

able on the world stage to lead by exemple which considering the reputation and international exposure of New Zealand can have a
very strong snowball effect! PS: I want mo make sure that although you will publish my submission and name on your website, my E-
mail address will remain private. Thanks




 
This is probably the most important legislation to be brought before parliament in the past decade....make sure that it moves quickly
through all stages and is well-passed before the next election. Implementing it only should be the election issue, not the bill itself
languishing in parliament.
The plan should involve the stopping of importing second hand cars from Japan. Second hand car dealers are still importing cars from
the 90's and selling them to New Zealand buyers. If we are to achieve the targets, banning the import and sale of passenger cars to

New Zealand that are a certain age must be enacted. There should be guidelines that state for example that no car older than
2005(?) should be imported into New Zealand for sale as a passenger vehicle. In addition to this, providing incentives and tax breaks
for car dealerships that make a commitment to import 40% of cars are electric vehicles by 2025 will reduce carbon emissions to

reach the 2050 targets, gradually increasing the 45% to 60% by 2050.
Dont do anything




 
What a massive waste of time and money. In the 1970's these sane scientists were worried about global cooling. In the 1400's
Europe suffered a mini Ice age.. I could go on. Climate change is a natural phenomenon that has been happening since the dawn of

time. Ask the dinosaurs
If farming is going to be engaged in this it must be done in good faith that all grass land, trees, scrub and any other forms of carbon
fixing should be calculated. Other areas of reducing costs for farmers should also be considered eg Rates (local and regional), Health

and safety, animal welfare costs, inheritance costs. I fear that in this process that the NZ farmers exports will nolonger be able to
compete in the rest of the worlds markets
Tax exemptions for fully electric cars (esp gst). Churches pay no tax on the basis that they (supposedly) do good, well buying an
expensive electric car is certainly doing good.
Please get some balanced views. If everyone involved is already sold on CAGW (now called Climate Change) then what is the point. Is
there any sceptis involved?
NZ largely depends on agriculture and is a world leader in this industry - the current proposal puts too much emphasis on reducing all

gases by 2050 without too much thought into what will happen to the agriculture industry and the flow on aeffects to all New
Zealanders as to standard of living ,wages ,jobs and general well being. A best case would be to target Co2 and working towards

clean energy and clean transport that is electrical vehicles.
It is already too late we are going to have to adapt to the new equilibrium's. However we have a chance of stopping it getting
excessively worse. The plastics in our seas will also be around for centuries and we need to help as much of our fellow Flora and

Fauna survive too if we can or at the end of this we will be alone.
Humans have no effect on the climate. CO2 pays no role in warming the planet. IPCC models have failed, and continue to fail,

because they attempt to shoehorn a vital trace gas into a role in which it plays no part. The arctic has not melted, winters have not
stopped and they never will. The sun is the primary driver of earth's climate, with modifications by cosmic rays, which modify both

solar activity and volcanic activity. The current warming from the last glacial period has come to an end, and from here on in it is going
to get colder. To destroy our economy and energy wealth to attempt to take control of something by limiting a vital trace gas is
criminal.




 
Thanks to MfE & Minister for offering wide consultation with the public at large. Been gagged for nine long years! Nice to have a voice

again. I consent to the publication of my name with this submission. I do not wish my residential address to be published; my
electronic address is fine.
Any further farm conversions to dairying should be disallowed and support given to farmers willing to revert to cropping or sheep
farming. Water for irrigation should come at a premium. There should be encouragement and support given to businesses finding
new uses for wool - a great example is Allbirds (shoes). Attention needs to be given to educating the public on the consequences of

climate change, the astromonical price of inaction, as well as the inevitable cost of action. Sacrifices will be required and, in a world
where progress seems to be measured in only material terms, many will find this a bitter pill to swallow unless they fully understand

the alternative. Forestry is obviously a huge priority but if it's to consist mostly of pines there would need to be some provision made
for dealing with wilding seedlings making their unwelcome presence known in areas of native bush or scenic value like the McKenzie

Basin. If electric cars are to take on in a big way there will need to be a proliferation of charging stations all over the country to deal
with so-called "range anxiety".
I would like my name to be withheld on the Ministry for the Environment's website to protect my privacy.
(In support of page 39) The government should implement policy that would assist vulnerable communities to adapt, since many of
them will be more adversely affected. Businesses that generate high emissions should innovate and develop in an agile way.

Ultimately, to succeed, stakeholders in all of society will need to do their part. It will be important for the Bill to start with well-informed
and meaningful policies.




 
I diepair that a change of government and the continued use of land for corporate farming will be the downfall of any plan sadly .
This proposed legislation is highly emotive and not based on facts. To date there is still no evidence that global warming is based on
anthropomorphic emissions. Global warming is a natural phenomena largely driven by natural emissions from eg volcanoes,

subduction gas emissions, seeps from underground reservoirs etc. Having said that, it would be irresponsible not to limit our
footprint on this planet. NASA has carried out studies from orbit of atmospheric CO2 and other 'greenhouse' gas concentrations.

Refer https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SgmFa0r04. This demonstrates seasonal high levels of CO2 in the Northern hemisphere
over winter months, much of which is absorbed by vegetation in the Spring and Summer. In the Southern Hemisphere, there are

almost no CO2 emissions. Much of these are from burning low grade coal in Australia, which is currently being reduced. My question
is why does NZ continue to damage our economy in a ineffective response to what is in effect a Northern Hemisphere problem?
As noted above, the adaptive process is different to controlling emissions and should be managed separately.
Climate change needs to be given priority in this country. It is not important that compared to other countries, our emissions are
small. Per capita, our emissions are an embarrassment. We must act now. Climate change must be given priority in this country.

Interests of industrial sectors are important. The economy is important. But climate change MUST be given priority. This requires
immediate action. It also requires consistent, ongoing action. I am most concerned about the priority this Act will be given over time,

as throughout history the interests of building the economy has always reigned. While the economy undoubtedly will still grow while
prioritising climate change (and may even benefit), not everyone may see it this way. I am worried at how future governments will see

it. I'm worried climate change will never be prioritised because it is so nebulous, and its effects are so hard to understand and pin
upon a single phenomenon. Even today its effects are being felt, and people still deny climate change is the root as there is no

definitive scientific way of doing this. This act needs priority within our government. Please consider entrenching something so
important. The UK act that this bill is highly influenced by is so successful due to the bi-partisan support it has enjoyed over history.
We clearly don't have that yet. Therefore, entrenchment is the only protection this act may have over its lifetime. We must also

consider incentives in ensuring action happens. The less discussed aspect of the UK Act is that the country is now struggling to
keep up with the demands of its future targets. No one knows how they will be achieved and at present it is doubted they can be. No

target has yet been failed to be met, but this may change soon. So how will we make sure the same won't happen here? I doubt a
voluntary basis will be enough to create the change needed for the ambition currently proposed by the government.
Government should be supporting research into carbon sequestration & greenhouse emissions by organic & other farming
methodology in order to inform best practise, since food production is one of our leading industries, we should not be afraid to make

the running on this.
I specifically wish electric vehicles and solar panel installations be given extensive financial and advisory support. One particular

support needed in the future will be the importation of Japanese used EVs which will no doubt increase in the near future.
We need to start behaving like the "clean green" country we pretend to be




 
I would like to see plans and considerations for the increasing number of climate refugees from our neighbouring countries, and how
we can both support and sustain them in their own country and eventually in our own.




 
Some form of tax rewards, public points system or self-assessment calculation systems or similar for households to assess, compare
or be rewarded for changes they make to reduce emissions (ie. electric car, replacing gas house/water heating with heat pump

heaters/cylinder, buying heatpump dryer, installing solar and/or battery storage etc etc)




 
no
Massive Global Warming hasn't happened, nor has massive Climate Change. Also there has been no change in sea levels.
While the global economic model is failing the vast majority of people on the planet, it is not failing all of the people the same. I want to

recommend that the coalition government considers UNDRIP and the Treaty of Waitangi and that a Zero Carbon Act adequately
engages the human rights issues that arise from the fossil-fuel industry; that is, the right to clean air to breathe and clean water to

drink, now and for generations to come.
We have committed would being emissions free by 2050 and I commend the courage to do this (bearing in mind the science shows
us that this will only leave us with an outside chance of reaching 2 degrees). To be emissions free we are looking at about 10%

reductions per year. Has the magnitude of this task been mapped out in terms of carbon budgets for each individual in New Zealand?
Starting from next year, people need to be emissions free for 1 month a year; this means no flying, driving or creating emissions from
food, power, water, heating. Do people realise this? I think the government needs to be honest with the public, 10% reductions per

year are probably not compatible with a growing economy This issue is something we have not historically had to deal with on a
global scale. It is unprecedented and therefore requires unprecedented policy making. Government needs to set the course and be

honest with the public about the situation. We are facing an enormous challenge - greater than any generation in history. Perhaps it is
prudent for the act to include penalties for politicians and leaders who do not act. Scientist attest to dire consequences if politicians

do not take drastic steps. This means MAJOR changes as a society in the next decade.



 
I have seen the effects of climate change and have been in rural environments for 35 years , from erosion polluted water ways

What you do is let the plants grow and go to seed works ever time
i dont think a carbon tax will get anyone on side with change - much better to re look at the ETS to make it more reflective of our
carbon users? and producers?
1. The discussion document continually cites impact on economic growth as the main criterion for the cost of mitigation measures. It
is time that this language was changed. Growth is not necessarily an indicator of benefit, and is finite, ie unsustainable. It is time that

public wellbeing and fulfilment are incorporated as a factor in overall cost/ benefit analysis of climate change response. 2. Agricultural
emissions must be brought in immediately. Agriculture cannot be exempted any longer as it is becoming a massive subsidy which will

increasingly be paid for by other industries and the general public. 3. Terminology- As a final comment, I think the use of "carbon" as a
heading in Table 1 to describe the net zero carbon dioxide target option is confusing and misleading, since methane is also a carbon
containing gas. Stick with the full name of the gas in the table headings and all references to this option, ie "Carbon Dioxide".
Keep financial interest out of it and realise that any difficulties that arise in the daily lives of NZ'ers as a result, pale in comparison to

the problems that will eventuate if we continue what we are doing.
Technological advances in gene editing and modification and improved significantly and need to be considered when looking at a 30
year pathway. Development of drought, flood and salt tolerant crops provides resilience and food security and if conducted effectively

will not be harmful to the NZ 'clean' brand. Crops that require less irrigation will improve water quality too. Of course we must look at
the risk vs opportunity in this space but I don't think it's wise for us to assume that depending on our clean image and brand is a sure

thing. We had this debate when margarine came out against butter. Social license must be considered but the scientific break
throughs in this field have huge potential and laws from 20 years ago today will be very old by 2050. This is something that shouldn't
be ignored. We must also consider the role of the ocean in this discussion. The oceans’ play a major role in climate change (as a

carbon pump, and through heat storage). Focusing solely on carbon content in the atmosphere fails to integrate the whole earth
system.




 
I applaud the considered and progressive approach to economic transformation that this Bill is a part of. I do not want my name,

house number, or phone number to be published in any form, including in print and on the web.



 
In the context of the devastation that will be wrought by climate change, for a wealthy nation such as New Zealand to adopt a Net

Zero target for 2050 is a weak commitment. To acheive a much swifter drawdown of emissions is well within technical and social
possibilities. It would require a more radical accounting for our global responsibilities and the purpose of our economy. In this context,

I would like to object to the framing of the discussion document suggesting that strong climate action will still allow for economic
growth, but that it may be reduced. Placing economic growth above a stable climate is the reason for the swiftly developing climate

crisis. These priorities need to be inverted.
The Coalition Government should be congratulated for taking this step as it is probably the key issue we will al have to face in the

medium term.
Thanks for putting together a fantastic consultation document, and for providing us an easy and straightforward way to have our say.
See earlier comment about linking carbon emissions to the place of final consumption, especially with regard to our meat and dairy

exports. Food consumed overseas by 40 million people should not be on the heads of 5 million New Zealanders, any more than a
laptop I buy should count against China. See: Druckman, A., & Jackson, T. (2009). The carbon footprint of UK households 1990–2004:
A socio-economically disaggregated, quasi-multi-regional input–output model. Ecological Economics, 68(7), 2066-2077.

doi:http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolecon.2009.01.013. In terms of transport, a lot of emphasis is given to cycling (rightly), but, based
on Household Travel Survey statistics for Christchurch that I have analysed, while around half of all trips are within cycling range (6

km), these only make up 15% of the total distance travelled and, therefore, the carbon emissions. Trips over 20 km are less than 10%
of trips but account for nearly half the distance travelled. Cycling is important for health and urban design reasons, but to reduce
carbon emissions, we need to reduce the carbon on *long* and medium length journeys. I can cycle everywhere in town, but one

driving holiday can undo all of those savings. That basically means rail - commuter rail and inter-city passenger rail, as well as for
freight. These options need to be the fastest and cheapest option. If they don't compete on speed and cost, they won't be adopted.

The carbon is in the longer trips, not the easily substitutible short trips.



 
Thank you for the opportunity to participate :)
Support to industries such as hemp farming
I trust in the Government, and I hope that through the Carbon Bill we set robust and strong targets that will get us to net zero carbon
by 2050. For our future and the future of generations to come, now is the time to act and make impactful changes for the betterment
of our people and our environment.
Need to consider soil experts, Dr Christine Jones is one in particular, John King of Succession Ltd for Holistic training
Global warming is a hoax, its only a small minority that is sucked into this scam but are driving it forward on the rest
Thank you for putting together the discussion document *our climate your say* and this fantastic e-form to enter submissions. Now
we have to make the blind see and the indifferent care.
Just hurry up before we are screwed




 
Ban Meat and Dairy Farming in New Zealand as their continued industry presence will compromise and sabotage the goal of net zero
emissions. Subsidise financially and legally endorse and support Vegan plant based food production businesses for human and

animal food, create a greater list of plant species enabled to sequester carbon such as Industrial Hemp, Manuka, Horticulture, NZ
Native forests in a polyculture not a monoculture.
I don't want my address or email to be disclosed.
This is a landmark bill for NZ. Emissions targets need to be set and reported on and adaptation needs to be better aligned and

coordinated. The most important element of this bill will be that successive governments do not have the power to significantly
change the targets or the role of the commission as a policy choice (e.g. make it an election issue). NZ needs long-term certainty on

our climate change response and goals, and this will only happen if politics are not allowed to interfere.
Be brave and bold, take a stand for the future. Changing the rules will encourage new innovations and tech, we can be at the front of

this exciting and essential shift in how we work with our planet to sustain our selves and those we share, if we change the rules we
work by.




 
Some specific policies to consider: - Subsidies and tax incentives to encourage renewable power and electric vehicle (including
ebikes) - Increased tariffs and tax on animal products and discounts on vegetable products - Investing in a smart grid that can handle

distributed power production - Setting goals to shift New Zealand's economy to be more sustainable - Aiming to reach carbon zero
earlier than 2050
The Paris Agreement is a hugely expensive joke and is more about the promotion of diversity and equaility through the redistibution
of first world wealth than climate change. We should not take it seriously to the detriment of our society when the biggest pollutors

continue openly on a path to ramp up emissions. Our emissions total is insignificant in the scope of things, especially when viewed in
light of developing worlds attitude towards emmission reduction. Our goals should reflect our significance and admit that Zero nett
carbon is nice but unobtainable dream, so lets be realistic and aim for 60% reduction. We can easily meet this target by some

moderate changes to agriculture to drive soil carbon capture but these would require a subsidisation model. Ie paying farmers to let
land lie in fallow and develop crops for soil carbon capture. Not likely we will embrace artificial economics like subsidization though.

Natural gas was one of the most effective forms of energy to assist on this pathway, zero logic in Governments decision sorry. Are we
prepared to get real about the cost of bunker fuel for shipping that drives the consumer based segment of our economy, or the real

cost of air travel that has massive increases in tourists projected? Doubt it. It is very easy to sort out our electricty and transition the
small percentage from coal generation to hydro or geo thermal capacity. Will environmntal groups support damming of rivers if it

means replacing Huntly? Is it possible to get planning consent to build a Hydro dam in the time we have left? One positive is that
political ideologies may be forced to accept common ground on some issues. If we are serious about a net zero carbon future we
need to disperse with many of the out-moded ideologies that pervade environmentalism. For example, the cyclone Ita legislation to

salvage timber on conservation land resulted in $40 million GDP generation, including $1.7 million direct conservation funding.
Approximately 6% of the allowable volume of timber was removed and an estimate 1/10th of 1% of the total downed biomass was

removed. This is a perfect example of local community response to a massive natural event and is important in the context that New
Zealand now imports $94 million of timber and $480 million of solid wooden furniture. Our indigenous industry produces around 4%

of what our society consumes. All these imports are produced under inferior legislation and shipped to NZ using bunker fuel that
does not reflect the true cost of emissions. By allowing a region like the West Coast to apply world leading resource management
practices to some of its plentiful natural resources we can create regional and national wealth and offset the damage of consumer

demand does globally. Try getting the limited, regulated use of windthrown timber past Eugene Sage James. Finally we are in a
position where ridiculous green ideology is diametrically opposed to itself. Time for a cup of tea before the world ends.
the money instead should be used to immediately engage in restorative farming and biodiversity loss. We already know the risks of

climate change and we need to act
Aims to change commercial, transport and domestic energy sources from "fossil fuels" to "electricity" are inane. Electricity is not an

energy source but a vector of energy. You have to produce it somehow. And since we want to increase forestry, where is this
"biomass" going to come from? Food crops are going to be needed for food, especially in the shrunken economy forecast. Hmm, an

d also I see the Cow Anti Fart Vaccine is still in "development" and has been for 17 years, not that hopeful. But my biggest gripe is, we
are stopping natural gas exploration and happily burning coal! Just like Germany, so that we can have electric cars - this is mad! No,

wait, it's politics...
I will reiterate that I think public eduction is essential to avoid this becoming only a short term policy which a successive government
will simply sweep away or downsize. On the Facebook thread that led me to this submission document nearly everyone who posted

something under the thread were making ridiculous and uninformed comments about climate change science. It is worrying that still
in 2018 there are so many people who think that just because climate change is slow, it must not be real.
And make this a compulsory part of conducting business - public and commercial.
There should be a zero waste program as well as a zero carbon emissions program




 
I do not want my personal details publishing anywhere publicly in relation to this submission.



 
Please make some changes. Our children will have nothing left to them but mess and distruction if we do not change our ways.

Please please please I really am begging for mother natures sake because no one is listening to her voice. Our people are ready for
change.
On a personal note, I am a Building Scientist (I make buildings more energy efficient as a tool for mitigating climate change) and I have

just had my role made redundant due to the large engineering firm no longer seeing any work in this area. This is really upsetting as
we know NZ's building stock needs serious assistance to become healthier and more energy efficient, and that there needs to be

drastic changed for NZ to reach its emissions targets - yet there is no work in this area in the buildings sector. So, I would love to see
new regulations put in place to make our buildings more energy efficient as a tool for mitigating climate change, as well as healthier.

This will require specialist skills like mine. From my experience this needs to be regulated. We can not rely on the developers or
architects/engineers to make this happen because the majority of people will only do it if they HAVE to. General comments:
Agriculture needs to be targeted, there needs to be mandatory reporting on GHG emissions and targets by each company, as well as

a plan for reaching the targets. Without this, we will not reach our international commitment to the Paris agreement as companies
tend to do the minimum required.
Thanks for the opportunity to make a submission. Reducing NZ emissions is not hard but many simple changes are required to they

way we use soils and this will meet stern resistance from our agricultural experts who have spent their lives working in the modern
high tech agricultural production systems that ignore the need for healthy soil microbiology. The need to change the impact our

production has on the water, atmosphere, our livelihood and our health is evident and many progressive farmers are already making
big gains in soil health, water quality and soil carbon levels. They are doing this by ignoring the main stream advisors in the industrial

farming businesses and instead are nourishing their soil microbial workforce to cycle nutrients, build humus and improve their
productivity.
Why is there not more emphasis on changing regulation of the power industry? At best this industry has green-washed whilst
introducing many barriers to entry for micro generation in discriminatory pricing in which those who invest in green power micro
generation are effectively subsidising those who do not. This works against any zero carbon strategy the government may have. The

industry needs re-regulating to ensure a positive contribution and support for those who personally want to help make zero carbon a
reality at their own cost and risk. It's low hanging fruit for the government.
It is essential that the workers in the fossil fuel industries, their families and their communities are helped to retrain and given
 generous financial assistance to enable them to transition to other well-paid jobs, other industries, and perhaps even to other

 regions. I support the policy proposals made by the New Zealand Council of Trade Unions about a Just Transition.
I only had time to read the summary and some sections where the questions pointed me to it. It is a very quick off the cuff
submission. I suggest that you include farming and business groups in your consultation as well as Iwi, social agencies etc. That is

make sure your consultation is far-reaching and the those groups are well represented by people who do have time to read the
document throughly.
Adapting to, and doing what we can to reduce climate change is the most important thing facing humans in our lifetime. We have

been handed a HUGE problem by our ancestors, and it has fallen on us to deal with the issue before it becomes "unsolvable" with
disastrous outcomes for us and future generations. We should have acted 100 years ago. We must act now. It is URGENT. The

economy and business and the public in general will not be able to tackle this themselves. It needs strong leadership from
government to do whats best for it's people. And that is to create an environment that humans can survive in for the foreseeable

future. We also have a role to play on the world stage, developing and sharing solutions, and leading the way to show what can be
done, with a little number 8 wire kiwi ingenuity.
It needs to look beyond our borders and the impact of international tourism should be included
as previously noted, public education on emissions, pollutants, and personal,corporate , and community responsibility needs

implementing , rules regulations n targets are all fine proposals but if ms n mr jo average are not constantly reminded of their own
contributing to the causes, and contributions to the reduction, then not much will change.
Keep the public informed of what their obligations are to assist and how to go about it in realistic goals of change to make it zero
emissions by 2050. Please do not publish my street address.
This is all unnecessary expenditure. There is no cause for climate panic. The temperature record disproves the climate models.
I urge the government to act decisively to put the legislation, organisations and plans for net zero emissions in place as soon as

practically possible. It's extremely important, and far too much time has been wasted by preceding governments.
It is imperative and timely that the current Government put in place robust systems, legislation, regulation and policies that are
enduring. Clear independent reporting requirements need to be instituted to ensure and enable maximum impact. These policy

infrastructure should be safeguarded from being dismantled or dramatically altered to suit the election-cycle (and industry lobbying).



 
Yes. Mandatory reporting and open the data.
This consultation document is a lot better than the last one. I attended a meeting and had reports of other meetings where the vast
majority of the feedback was ignored in the final outcome. Make sure this process is genuine this time.
This is long over due!
Please don't share my e.mail address on your web site.




 
I want to reiterate my total opposition to the E.T.S. The governments review of the scheme in 2016 found that it had had no
significant effect in reducing emissions. Other countries have had similar problems. I favour a carbon tax which is initially set at the

current market level of ETS credits. It should automatically increase by 5% cumulatively each year so that polluters can see from the
outset that reducing emissions is the only acceptable way of staying in business. Credits could be used to pay the tax during the first

5 years but would stay at the 2018 market price, so that they would steadily become less valuable in paying the tax. We must keep as
a top priority, the need to stop further global warming and also work towards reversing warming that has already taken place so that
we can return to temperatures as at mid 20th century & around 350 ppm of CO2 or less in the atmosphere. I suggest two measures

which will help achieve a zero carbon economy: 1) Legislate to stop the sales of new internal combustion engines by 2040 or earlier.
If this is done now then individuals and businesses will get a clear message that fossil fuel use is on the way out. Transport

contributes 19% of NZ CO2 emissions plus some N2O emissions so will have to be cut some time anyway. 2) Legislate that all new
buildings must be energy self sufficient. This will have a dual effect of taking the strain off energy providers as electric vehicles make

more demands on the system, and also provide for charging EV's at home and work without using grid power. The other advantage
would be to make buildings more resilient after earthquakes or other natural disasters.
I believe the Zero Carbon Bill is an essential part of ensuring the future of New Zealand, and placing us as a leader among
environmentally responsible nations of the world. It can also be managed in such a way as to create new business opportunities for

New Zealanders and ensure we transition to a future focused green economy.



 
The highlighting of Climate Change appears to continually focus on the Polar Ice Caps and I believe a large number of People do not

 readily associate themselves with anything beyond their back door. In the course of exploring the reasons for depletion of Toheroa on
 Ninety Mile Beach I discovered that in response to a relatively small increase in Temperature over the last sixty Years our Climate has
 undergone a massive change with a complete reversal in Previously Prevailing Winds . This Change is part of a global influence but
 there is a good chance that Toheroa is the disappearing Canary in the Coal Mine and the indicator for the next Native Species unable

 to adapt to the speed of Climate Change The factors causing the reversal of our Winds and the tropicalisation are not if ever exposed
 but are an example of powerful Change Here Today.
Let's go!
Introduce tax incentives when deciding to purchase a fully electric vehicle. This is what most progressive governments overseas
does.
Sharing information is critical as it enables organisation to learn from each other and subsequently adapt their activities more rapidly
without all having to undertake costly research development investigations.




 
Stephen Hawking thought we should find another planet to live on, such is the damage we have inflicted on our current one. To date,

we don't know of another habitable planet (and if there is one, we are probably the worst thing that could happen to it), so our efforts
need to be dedicated to making this one healthy again. Our children and grandchildren are destined to carry a greater climate burden

than the baby boom generation has, though the burden has been fashioned largely by the boomers. Those in developing countries,
who have benefited least from "modern conveniences", are paying the greatest price and will continue to do so. Changes in our

behaviours now can begin to reduce the misery into the future. Our actions to date have taken scant account of the long term
consequences; inaction now would be unforgivable.
There should be more effective incentives for farmers to transfer their property to low-emission or even negative emission (through
reforestation) land. There should be more effective incentives for reducing the number of fuel-powered vehicles. There should also

be more effective incentives for increasing renewable energy production, as well as reducing energy loss from buildings (i.e.
incentives for insulation).
Please see attached document (Zero Carbon Bill Submission Supplementary Comments.pdf)
I think that this is one of the most important issues that our country will face, because although it might not seem like a big deal now,

this decision will affect not only the future of our country but the people who live here now and in the future. Not only will it help New
Zealand retain its clean green image but will ultimately help the entire world.
The focus should be on reducing the source of man made emissions through subsidies of electric transportation and on innovation,

already being undetaken, in the agriculture sector to inhibit emissions. According to the NZAGRC agricultures net emissions have
fallen since 1990 due to higher efficiency. Agriculture should not be included in ETS when they are competing in the world market
with countries such as Norway whose farmers get 60% of their income from governement subsidies. More emphasis should be

placed on the use of humates and other microbial feeders to imprive soil aeration and root depth to increase the ability to sequester
carbon and drastically reduce the use of N fertilisers. I do not wish and do not consent to my submission to be published on the
ministry for the environments website.




 
Amazing policy work here. You are on the right track. This is so important to our future!!
There is so much information telling us that climate change is a myth. Please Please check it out before going any further with this.

 The climate is a natural occurrence and we should not be taxed for it!
Carbon Zero may be inappropriate. If global warming is cyclical this bill is just a pollution control bill and it must not have teeth if it is to
survive in any form.
Please implement a framework that makes meaningful positive differences to the environment and the people of Aotearoa.




 
In agriculture it is management that determines whether the farm is a net source or sink. We either degrade the land or regenerate
depending on grazing policies. Regeneration sequesters carbon in soil and increased biomass. Same applies for forestry and
horticulture. To say a cow burps methane and a tree is made of wood is grossly over simplistic. If your best solution is more radiata

pine monocultures and all the negative environmental consequences of that we are truly devoid of imagination.
I believe an important part of moving towards zero emissions is to reduce/eliminate the farming and consumption of animals and their

products. Consuming animal products is detrimental to our health and only places a further toll on our health system. Therefore the
NZ Government should be focusing on this issue as a way of reducing the harm animal agriculture places on our environment and

our health.



 
What ever is set, it must be based on science, please refer to your document. Any target we set needs to be informed by the best

available climate change science. Nearly half of New Zealand’s greenhouse gas emissions come from agriculture, which means we
need to pay particular attention to the scientific impact of short-lived gases like methane, which dominate agriculture’s emissions.

SHORT-LIVED AND LONG-LIVED GASES Short-lived gases like methane decay relatively rapidly in the atmosphere. They last for
decades rather than centuries. This means global temperatures can be stabilised without necessarily reducing emissions of these
gases to zero. We also have an opportunity to lower the impact even further by not only stabilising but also, where possible, reducing

short-lived gases from our economy. Long-lived gases like carbon dioxide either need to reduce entirely to zero or at least to the
point where emissions can be balanced out by an equal amount of removals.
Emissions reductions should be effective and made within New Zealand not by buying overseas credits and it should be just to

people on lower incomes .
Every BEV imported into NZ will be fueled from indigenous sources over its lifetime. In contrast, every petrol or diesel vehicle,
including hybrids, will require NZ to continue to import oil to fuel that vehicle over its lifetime. The sooner we get the planned targets
in place, the better off we will be. Investment and business decisions are generally multi-year choices, and the government has

responsibility to provide clear directions across all sectors of the economy. Aggressive targets will need some hard selling, but we can
follow other markets where these signals have already been made. For example, bans on sale of petrol or diesel vehicles after 2040

in the UK and sooner in other countries, getting the power grid to 100% renewables as in Iceland. Incentives and disincentives to
push change will be needed. For example, a surcharge on the sticker price of petrol and diesel fueled vehicles, including hybrids, with
the proceeds to be used to fund charging infrastructure. NZTA to collect the odometer readings at registration time to enable the

calculation of a usage charge to eventually replace fuel taxes. Registration fees to be minimal for BEVs for the first 5 years, while
increasing on a scale for petrol and diesel vehicles.
I am relieved we have had a change of government and this proposal is in front of us. Thank you.
The document is overly focused on the economy. I find it very inappropriate, given that it is question here of (1) our survival as a

species, (2) our moral obligations towards the living beings and our future generations and (3) the development of New Zealand as a
nation and society. Vision needs to lead, not the economy. The economy needs to transition in a way that supports the vision. In the
opportunities, a few key elements are missing: (1) modal shift in transport: reduced overall costs (infrastructure, environment, health,

participation in the local economy, people's well-being) (2) Increased accessibility an participation, through a less car-dominated
system. The current situation makes it difficult for whole demographics to participate in the economy, education, or other
opportunities (see work of Karen Witten et al, on transport-related severance in NZ). Philipp McCann had made a clear case for more

accessible and better functioning cities - I had put some key points and links here: https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/case-cities-new-
zealands-economy-tamara-bozovic/ (3) better water quality, through decreased dairy and animal farming (I do hope that the biggest

generator of pollution will be tackled and that animal-oriented agriculture will transition to plant-based sustainable farming, for
environmental but also moral and ethical reasons). This will have positive outcomes on health but also tourism, matching the "100%
pure" label In terms of solutions, the EVs should not be presented as one for cleaner air, given their high emissions of thin particles

(https://www.thenewamerican.com/tech/item/23226-study-electric-vehicles-pollute-more-than-gas-powered-cars ). They are also
hardly an environmentally-friendly solution at all, given the needs for non renewable materials, roads, further contribution to urban

sprawl and continued need of roads & road renewals. The end of oil will mean the end of asphalt too, but also the need for more
resource-efficient transport solutions. Finally, while I am thankful for the opportunity to contribute (noting I am not a New Zealander
but do consider myself as a contributor to this society), I regret the level of language of this document and the formulation of the

questions, making them not necessarily accessible to all.



 
I know there is no silver bullet to fix CC. Nevertheless long term gains will come from the high tech sector and we must stay up with
innovations and the govt must have resources to contribute and incentivize. Among the many technologies that are fast evolving in

China and India is nuclear thorium. The word nuclear is toxic politically in NZ but we must change that when Thorium technologies
evolve. At present our regulatory environment condemns everything vaguely nuclear and fails to distinguish between environmentally

safe and unsafe. Potentially Thorium plants could: Be scaleable down to units the size of shipping containers thus eliminating
kilometers of high voltage transmission lines and our whole national grid The energy could benefit the whole economy and replace
gas generation It can make safe nuclear waste It can produce rare earths as a by product and break China's monopoly on these

products that are so vital for high tech solutions It could provide abundant power for our future green transport and all the other uses
we have for it. Tree planting is e temporary fix. Reducing emissions is long term. Given abundant electrical energy we could clean up

our farming and industrial emissions too.



 
I do not give permission/consent to publish any part of this submission with my name. I do not wish my name to be included in any
summary of submissions that the Ministry may publish.
This bill is a total waste of Tax Payers money and this Government should not be introducing it
All local governments, state owned enterprises and crown entities need to plan and prepare for climate change. Such planning
should be publicly available.
Good luck. I support this work and am prepared to make personal changes in order for NZ to step up and be a world leader in this
arena.
This bill is very very important. Climate change is an externality from so many human endeavours that leadership must come from
central government. I hope NZ's government will set a course to reach net zero emissions and eliminate our contribution to a global

problem. Beyond the scope of this bill, I hope they advocate internationally for other countries to match our goals. The current
practice of exempting livestock emissions from the ETS is arbitrary and unfair to other industries. The effect on our climate is the

same regardless of where gasses are produced, and our policy should reflect that.
Just to reiterate that climate change is probably the most (but not only) environmental crisis that we face, and there is a risk of its
turning into an existential crisis. We should concentrate on removing our contribution to climate change forcing. We should also note

that the impacts of climate change may not change because of our actions in this country alone, so adaptation strategies should,
initially, assume that climate change will continue to track on the worst case scenario.
I do not want my name published. Living here is dangerous enough for a 'tree-hugger' without this.
Ngā mihi — this is crucial work and I'm pleased to see New Zealand starting on it in earnest.
Can someone please explain why pastoral farming is implicated as a contributor to net emissions when in fact it is a carbon neutral

 and natural part of the carbon cycle? All forage consumed by grazing herbivores fixes CO2 from the atmosphere and part of this
 captured carbon is returned to the atmosphere as a result of the digestive process in the form of methane, a short lived gas as
 compared to CO2. Part of the consumed forage carbon is retained by the soil as pasture litter breaks down and part is retained by the
 animal as it grows bone and muscle tissue, wool or dairy product. It could therefore be argued that pastoral farming is better than

 carbon neutral and should be lauded as a carbon credit industry rather than a net polluter. If the argument is pursued that pastoral
 farming is a carbon emitter then consideration needs to given to "where did that carbon come from?"
The country needs to make a strong move away from animal agriculture into more environmentally sustainable businesses.
I see that your current policy on woodsmoke is very thin. The only low emission woodburners on the market are the Pyro Classic and

pellet burners, which emit carbon dioxide ( a climate change gas). All other so called 'low emsission burners' are dependent on
correct burning to emit only carbon dioxide. Once people lose a bright rolling flame, the box cools, the wood smoulders and high

levels of smoke are produced. It is impossible to maintain a hot burning rolling flame consistently, no one has the level of attention to
do that. So in fact the 'low emission burners being advertised by the industry are not. They are as polluting as the old ones over their

lifetime. There is a misconception that dry wood does not produce smoke. Anything that is burned produces toxic smoke - tobacco,
wood, oil...
I have spent time with people working in the alternative energy industry in Britain, and have been amazed at the scale of change in
Britain. NZ has had its head in the sand for too long. The work done so far on this act seems to me to be heading in the right

direction.
Solar scientists are claiming that due to the current 11 year low solar cycle 24 and even lower solar cycle 25 forecast we are heading
 for a freezing period of possibly some 30 to 50 years ahead. With current global satellite temperatures being similar to those of a
 dozen and more years ago, it appears the Solar Scientists are correct and you are planning for warming when you should be planning

 for cooling temperatures in the years ahead. I have just checked the ice extent graphs for the Arctic and the Antarctic and both show
 increased ice extent this year. Global temperatures over the last years since the recent El Nino are showing a rapid decline even
 though carbon fuel use is increasing worldwide. Carbon dioxide is a vital gas at only 0.04 % of the atmosphere by volume that plants

 need and thrive on. The amount man produces is even less at 0.0004%. That is such a tiny amount it can be hard to imagine so I
 have made a calculation..... If the earths atmosphere is represented by a sheet of A4 paper, then mans contribution of CO2 is
 represented by a tiny full stop. Yet that miniscule dot of CO2 is supposed to be Earths climate control knob ??? You need to seriously

 consider that those Solar Scientists are correct and planning needs to be made now for a cooling period ahead with all the problems
 that will bring for various power production, power transmission and outages, housing warmth, difficulties with food production and
 shorter growing periods, transport and vehicle fuel supplies.
Option three and four are very similar in terms of actual effect on the atmosphere but option three is far more achievable. Enteric

 methane from livestock leaves an equilibrium amount of methane in the atmosphere which has already stabilized as livestock
 numbers have done. All that is left after the methane has degraded is the CO2 from whence it came in the first place. For this reason
 methane should always have considered as a separate issue and not just lumped in with all of the long term gases. A huge disservice

 has been done to New Zealand and agriculture in particular by this monumental blunder .For example the " 40% of our emissions
 from agriculture" that we hear so often is scientifically a nonsense yet we are at risk of making ridiculous policy decisions on the
 strength of it.As well as that, New Zealand's emissions are actually much less per person than we have declared . We are also wasting

 some $20m per year on research to mitigate emissions that in fact have very little effect on the planet.
We've been kicking the can down the road on climate change for a hundred years. We are long overdue for serious action, in the face
of a crisis that could have been avoided. I want to see the government provide a clear signal that we can no longer accept delaying
tactics and obfuscation. Targets should be strong and clear, and incentives aligned towards real change.
The science of man-made global warming is not settled. Zero emission targets based on ideologies and not settled science is not a
sound policy. Your plan must be based on cold, hard scientific numbers only. Your plan is destructive, not constructive. India and

China are the two largest emitters of CO2 and it is common knowledge that these countries, including Germany, Japan, and France,
plan to construct 1,600+ coal-fired power plants. NZs contribution to global carbon dioxide emissions is negligible (close to zero).
Rather than legislate a new emissions target for NZ, focus efforts to convince President Xi Jinping or Prime Minister, Narendra Modi to

follow your proposed tax theory to reduce CO2 emissions, then your effort would be laudable within your ideological drive. Your
advisors knowledge of science is wrong. Use of the expression Carbon Bill and not Carbon Dioxide bill is evidence of that. The target,

if NZ needs one, should be based on settled science. NZ Government have not considered all arguments of the global warming
science. It is now common knowledge that global temperatures have not increased in the last 20 years. Other countries (including

India and China) still plan to construct coal fired power stations, which will increase CO2 emissions significantly (+40% estimated). So
a net zero carbon dioxide emission reduction by NZ is a futile exercise and will do next to nothing for global emissions. The bill will
hurt NZ residents.
This should probably be part of the Commerce Commission, because it has strong impacts on business viability.
Timeframes are essential to this




 
As a Kiwi selling NZ Food and Beverage products in China for the last 20+yrs I can attest to the incredible market value our
Clean/Green image provides. Unfortunately with the last Government's lack of concern for this, our Pure NZ brand is now totally on

the rocks as well expressed by the UK Guardians article "Dirty Little Paradise" As an economy with over 70% of our GDP relate on
agribusiness, economics and the environment are allies in building our international reputation/"Point of Difference" and

subsequently a prosperous nation. Due to our size, location and economic base we have a unique opportunity to take the lead on
the world stage as the cleanest economy in the world, without that what do we really have to offer the world of any real economic

value? English schools? Bungy jumping??!! Our moment is here. Lets show resolve and courage to meet the greatest challenge of a
generation.




 
Household and community scale forest gardens and food forests can provide a decentralised solution to provide food and resources

to New Zealanders while also sinking carbon, reducing food miles and freeing land from industrial food production allowing it to be
returned to native forest cover (further sinking carbon and helping stabilise New Zealand's climate).
Climate change has been my main environmental concern for 25 years! I am very frustrated by the slowness to act and cheer on this

government's resolve to legislate to reduce emissions asap! Vital work.
Information sharing allows better decisions to be made.



 
To reduce our carbon footprint I feel that the top of buildings in CDB areas of cities should have hanging gardens, gardens and trees

which will not only make the view from tall buildings such as hotels better but also provide employment for people to maintain these
rooftop gardens. Maybe start with Gisborne if you need a "guinea pig"
It shouldn't be the Government to tackle this issue, whenever the government tries to change human behaviour it always backfires. It

should be left to innovative businesses and technology which overtime will reduce emissions. Also more study should be done to
see if human made emission are causing a adverse effects. The planet is over 300 million years old and we only have scientific data
from the last few hundred years, with only a third being accurate.
We have already locked in climate change to some extent, so adapting will be inevitable. If other countries don't play their part, then

we need to be prepared. If not in the Zero Carbon Bill, another bill should cover adapting to climate change.



 
#climatejustice!
I wish to speak in support of my submission at any hearings or select committee process that arises in this consultation process. I
believe this is the most important legislation considered in the 52nd Parliament. Need to take an exponential decay approach, i.e.

biggest decreases in emissions in early years, moderate in mid years, and slower in last years. There needs to be a strong
compulsion on all local govts in NZ to set and deliver on these budgets as well; otherwise you'll get all sorts of cross boundary
failures to set appropriate strategy and planning in place at local level. Many Councils are in denial. For instance Horizons Regional

Council was presented with numerous submissions during the 2018 Long Term Plan consultation that lay out the rationale for setting
a GHG emissions abatement target. A subsequent recommendation to establish such a target was only briefly considered, and lost

10-2. Without compulsion on local govt, there will be a major and dangerous lag in delivery on the NZ budgets.
I strongly support a Zero Carbon Bill that has targets and an adaption strategy and I really hope that their is cross party support for
this bill
I believe that passing this bill, and following through on the targets that it sets, are essential for New Zealand's long term wellbeing
and prosperity. If we fail to act on climate change now, we will not get another chance to fix the damage later on. It is not something
that we can address retroactively. We need to set ambitious targets, and we need to achieve them. Because of this, I believe that,

before anything else, this bill needs to be robust. It needs to have impact, and it needs to last. My fear is that successive
governments who may be less comitted to combating climate change than the present government will water it down, or set less

ambitious targets than we need to make a positive impact on our environment. I think that there needs to be some provision to keep
this from happening. Additionally, with all due respect to New Zealand's business community, their interests cannot be allowed to

define this legislation. Targets should take them into account, but must not be subordinate to them. This will only reduce the bill''s
effectiveness, and hamstring any progress we make.




 
Do not forget the emissions from composting vegetable material - to make one unit of digest-able human food generally requires the

same amount of gas regardless of farming mechanism. Keep reminding the population that human breeding is a big problem -
because we make gas.
this is really important. most important is independent climate commission able to give advice to govt and a net zero target for all
gases. its not about protecting existing big business, new climate-sustainable businesses will grow.
Anthropogenic climate change is a sham and we can't. Alter the global climate without massive cooperation from many much larger

countries we dont have to be the leaders at everything especially not spending time and money pushing the proverbially up hill to
accomplish nothing significant! Don't set emission targets until we can measure the benefit of doing so or fund cleaner alternatives

so we organically move to them more quickly and the larger scale of use will also bring the costs diwn
So happy to see this, it's well overdue!




 
I endorse the following comment from Jeanette Fitzsimons: There's nothing magical about 2050. Rapid reductions now, taking

advantage of all the easy options right away, then slowing down the rate when things get harder, will warm the climate less by 2050
than waiting till the last minute, then taking extreme action.
Not sure whether a Climate Change Commission will be able to leverage the desirable change. It just seems to be another advice-
giving body. Please withold my name and contact details from any publications or info release.
Thank you for commitment to a carbon neutral, future focused, sustainable, clean green New Zealand.
Encouraging electric car purchase by bulk buying by government of electric vehicles and solar power equipment from overseas and
selling in NZ. Making dairy farmers pay for damage done to environment and clean ups.
I think it is worth exploring, and evaluating whether it would be effective would be extremely important




 
This is the most important legislation for the government and the country. It is literally about the future of the planet - and the fate of
our grandchildren and successive generations.
I'm really pleased to see central government leading on this matter. If we can transition well we have the ability to lead globally in
innovations within the agriculture, dairy, viticulture, movie and tourism sectors.




 
We need action, far seeing, visionary action. Anything less is a cop out!
Thank you for the "Our Climate, Your Say", meeting, held in Gisborne last week. There was a lot of information shared, and it was well
presented.
Net zero emissions need to be calculated based on scientific and proven rates of production and removal of emissions. The

commission should be strong in it's recommendations. If a carbon tax is to be created, it must be done to take into account all
emissions and removal with money raised from a tax put directly back into emission reduction schemes, new technology for emission

reduction (NZ based) and for climate change adaption.
Planting trees is a clear part of reaching our zero carbon target. We need to ensure that we are planting trees that are of long term
ecological benefit to the region in which they are planted. Forestry is likely to be a part of this equation but should only be a part due

to negative ecological impact of forestry in some areas (effects of monoculture on biodiversity, runoff and environmental damage
during harvesting, loss of carbon sink between harvesting and replanting.
Impact investing is the key. We must provide better alternatives to the environment damaging goods we are accustomed to. large

established corporates will likely not not make a moral shift, they will only change their ways if their consumers start buying more
environmentally friendly goods. For consumers to do this, there must be better alternatives available, and for this to happen, impact
investing is the solution, from a government to private investing levels.




 
Stop cutting trees down and burning them and there would be zero net carbon overnight.
This needs to be prioritised at the HIGHEST level of urgency.




 
This is the biggest issue for humanity’s future and it is urgent. Delighted that we finally have a government taking it seriously - please

take all possible action to secure a safe future for our country and our world.
Anything that encourages organisations working more closely together to achieve this goal should happen. We need to think
holistically and not in silos or with fragmented efforts. This is as encompassing as the air we all breathe and the clean water we all
need to survive. A collective effort is needed even though we might not agree on everything. It's the big picture that's at stake here.
This document presupposes that man made Carbon dioxide emissions are the major cause of global warning. Science does not
support this. Action required. Review the "real science" (not mathematical models based on very limited data and are continually

proven wrong by new data) which seems to indicate carbon dioxide levels increase after global warming, not cause it. Have a plan for
NZ to adapt to climate change, address pollution in the form of carbon particles and other gases in the air, swimmable rivers, clean

harbours, plastics recycling, making NZ organic. Carbon dioxide is a colourless odourless gas we all breathe out, not a pollutant. New
Zealand should be leading the world in questioning the science.
just get on with it and take a lead for goodness sake. Also take on the mantra of SHARE THE PLANET rather than 'save the planet'. ie:
the planet will go on and on whatever mess its in whereas its it is left in a mess, humans and other species will not survive.
More action needs to be taken on the impact of NZs huge animal agriculture business on the environment and carbon emissions /
climate change. This is far too marginalized, despite how huge a contributor it is and how many other severe environmental impacts it

has. We need to move away from this and shift toward another major economic basis that is not so environmentally damaging.
We must act soon. We as New Zealanders must take our share of responsibility for the current crisis. The emissions of green-house
gasses per person in New Zealand is one of the highest in the world. Every company and organization and individual must be taxed
so that the burden of reduction-cost is shared equally. Changes must start immediately.
The methane problem of New Zealand livestock is a doubtful one as the carbon from the air grows plant material which the ruminant

eats and it produces methane into the air as a heating gas. This methane will eventually return to carbon to grow more plants to go
around again as has been happening for millenias. I can see the politics of envy are likely to make the control of methane a tempting

step for a government to tackle as it will look good internationally and will have a minimal effect on the voter base until the declining
overseas income from agriculture starts to hit the overall wealth of the population and the country's living standard deteriorates. New
Zealand has approximately 10 million cattle,of which 6 million are dairy and 4 million are beef.From the United Nations Food and

Agriculture figures, the latest world farmed cattle and buffalo population is February 2012 and then there were 1622 million farmed in
the world. New Zealand 's farmed cattle share is 0.62% of the world's and our dairy is only 0.37% so we are not a very large

contributor if methane is a problem.. I heard the prime minister saying we are going to to the the right thing because it is the right
thing when referring to NZ agricultural emmssions. Agriculture in most other countries is much poorer than ours. Approximately 75 %

of the cattle and buffalos are in developing countries and they are unlikely to follow our example as most peasant farmers must
remain emitters in order for their families to survive. Their animals not only produce the family food and income but oxen are also
often used to till the crops and dried cattle dung is often the only fuel that farmers have to cook their food with. Of the other 25% of

world cattle farmed in the more wealthy nations many are heavily supported by taxpayer subsidies and so they also are unlikely to
follow NZ's lead if we add costs to our cattle farmers. Any increase in costs to the farmers of the industrial world would likely lead to an

increase in demand for subsidy support both in Europe and North America. That would be hard to sell to voting taxpayers of an
electorate in a democracy. On top of that there are lots other farmed ruminants. Sheep, goats and camels on farms outnumber

farmed cattle and buffalos. They make up another 2000 millions and many of these are also in developing countries. Then of course
there is the problem of how can we control the emissions from all the ruminants that are not farmed but are wandering free and
gobbling plant material across the world from the giraffes and antelopes in Africa to the reindeer of Siberia. How and who is

responsible for these emissions? At the same time no country is willing to put an emission tax on jet fuel and make the air travel
industry pay for the damage they cause to the atmosphere. Jet travel is convenient for the wealthy of the planet and a luxury the poor

can never aspire to. It is an indecent squandering of our carbon heritage to benefit the few but it is those same few that make the
decisions who use air travel most and so therefore airlines are never likely to be held to account for the damage that jet travel has

caused.
It is good to see New Zealand making a start on future proofing the New Zealand economy and the welfare of future generations.
However, we are starting on this journey very late and it is going to be a much more painful and expensive journey than it would have

been had we started 15 years ago when the the accelerating rate of global heating had been clearly identified by our scientists.
Please don't post my name publicly.




 
my name and private details should not be published in any way. my submission is available to all.
Adapting to climate change will require investment, innovation and collaborative efforts- as will mitigation so there might be benefit in

the same framework tackling both issues.
I would like to see 2050 adopted as a minimum and if possible a shorter timescale should be considered.
Reconsider the entire policy as outlined in my opening comments
Climate change is natural and not man made. A zero carbon bill will have a bad effect on the economy and our standard of living.
No zero emissions, no climate change legislation without a public referendum to give a clear mandate. The current government does

not have such a mandate.
This proposal is based on flawed, not proven, absolutely false information that the proposers should be charged with the attempted
 MURDER of New Zealand.
A Zero Carbon Bill will create a vast bureaucracy: A Climate Change Commission, ‘emissions budgets’, climate change adaptation

plans, and emissions targets. Since livestock are carbon neutral, methane from agriculture should not be included in emissions
targets. Without methane, New Zealand would have one of the smallest greenhouse gas emissions profiles in the developed world.

In fact, no gases should be included in emissions targets, because just like the Emissions Trading Scheme, the proposed Zero
Carbon Bill will create a costly nightmare of red tape and bureaucracy that will waste time and money, drag down the economy, and

destroy businesses and jobs – all for no benefit.



 
Scrap it.
I believe that a policy can be drawn up but must be taken to the next election by the Coalition Parties as their Mandate on Climate
Change if the are Elected for a Second Term..
"In a time of universal deceit — telling the truth is a revolutionary act." - George Orwell
dump it.
Passing this bill is economic suicide for New Zealand.




 
New Zealand has done too little for a long time. Let's get cracking - now.
We are a carbon based lifeform, so the zero carbon policy is totally cretinous and farcical.
The Earth rotates around the sun. Sometimes its closer and sometimes its further away so its either hotter or cooler. Thats the only

climate change.
This form is a loaded questionnaire and does not represent a submission that represents my personal view. It presents questions
that support a pre-determined outcome and should not be used as evidence of consultation and the publics collective position on

this bill
If we look at the 'Paris Agreement' and targets of 11% below 1990 levels and look at population growth the logistics of reducing
greenhouse gases become exceedingly difficult. In 1990 New Zealand had a population of 3.414 million, today our population at 4.76

million is 39% higher. We had to be 11% below 1990 levels so effectively at this moment in time every person that was alive in 1990
should have a carbon footprint 50% smaller than they did back then. But our Paris target was for 2030 (estimated population 5.2

million or a 9.5% increase); so by then every person that was alive in 1990 must have a carbon footprint 60% smaller than it was back
then. If we continue this extrapolation to 2050 then the carbon footprint of someone alive in 1990 needs to be 78% smaller than it

was back then. This is totally unrealistic; the only logical way to stem greenhouse gas emissions is to STOP population growth and
more importantly STOP IMMIGRATION. Global warming is an international problem caused by globalisation; one where the major
emitters are the Asian block of countries (China, India, Japan, Korea, Indonesia, Phillipines, etc) whom emitt >50% of all greenhouse

gases. International pressure either through diplomacy (foreign affairs) or trade (an embargo on goods with high carbon footprints)
must be imposed to arrest the growth in greenhouse gases from China and India especially. We MUST REDUCE ELECTRICITY PRICES

if New Zealand is going to remain competitive. The free-market model for electricity implemented by the last 2 National governments
has resulted in New Zealand having some of the most expensive electricity prices in the world. In India electricity is 5-6.5c per unit, in

China 8c per unit, in Canada 10c per unit, in the USA 12c per unit, in the UK 20c per unit; but here in NZ it is 28c per unit. When we
are reliant on electricity for energy and transport we cannot afford to pay the current price. Quite simple we will not be competitive in
international markets. We must transition away from current agricultural commodities to horticulture. This should start now with

seeding finance for synthetic milk and synthetic meat production. Agriculture must pay for high livestock emissions which will
enhance the rate of change. A tax on nitrogen-based fertilizers must be imposed to reduce nitrates in surface and groundwater; and

reduce emissions of nitrous oxide. One of the principle risks is we are locked into Keynesian economics which is a paradigm requiring
compounded growth in all economic indicators to provide a workable framework for our economy. How can we have an economy with
compounded growth year on year, when in fact we require compounded recessions year on year in our carbon footprint? How can

compounded human impacts on ecosystems continue year on year when we want compounded growth of biodiversity to sequester
carbon? How can compounded population growth continue year on year when the overshoot in world population currently exceeds 2

billion people and overshoot in the New Zealand population is almost 1 million people? What is the model for sustainability, because it
certainly isn’t what we have got at the minute.
I believe that this propsed Bill is premature and should be preceded by rigourous information disclosure of cause and effect and

cost/benefit. Public debate should be sought to determine a course of action for NZ, (a sovereign nation) preferably by way of a
binding referendum.
All public organisations with control over property and control over the degree of risk to the public from that property in terms of
climate change must share information on their risk. This should include central government, local government, council controlled

organisations, public companies, private companies that offer publicly investment options (crowd funding, or investment by equity
funds).




 
Even though it seems clear that the UN and the IPCC believe they have an understanding of the future of the planets climate the
science is not settled. As an MSc in Earth Science and now 28 years of reading and understanding of the sciences behind how our

planet works I am deeply troubled that we are rushing into policy without a reasonable certainty of the science. The precautionary
principle is usually used when there is no real risk of negative affect and in this legislation there is massive risk to our most vulnerable

population. There is no harm in waiting for a year or two to at least have a better understanding of what the future holds. There are
many examples in the literature and in the data, for instance, that show no risk of sealevel reaching even the range of heights
mentioned in the report within 100 years (NZ data used). Nor is there any evidence that substantiates the increase in extreme

weather events beyond normal background events. I note there is no obvious way to verbally submit on this bill but I am happy to
present to the Ministry at any time required post submission date data that shows the hypothesis "Increasing Human caused CO2 in

the atmosphere will cause accelerated sea level rise, increased severity and frequency of extreme weather, acidification of the worlds
oceans or catastrophic melting of the polar ice caps" has already failed and that we may well be embarking on a fools errand. There
are areas of pollution that we do need to remedy but this bill will go no way towards any of that and is likely to cost us as New

Zealanders dearly. How do I make a verbal submission?
I've made a few as I went through. The most important one is that before this Bill is even discussed, there should be a very thorough

examination of unbiased research to see if, in fact, climate change is being driven by human activities. Two questions must be asked
and answered: 1. If the climate changes rapidly in the other direction, i.e. it begins cooling as it has over the past few years, what will
be the response of the government? Maybe to burn oil to produce more CO2? 2. If climate keeps on changing, will that mean that we

will require a less than zero carbon Bill? What will be the government's response when they find, as they will, that regardless of what
they do, the climate continues to do its own thing? No, you won't have thought of these and certainly won't want to think of them in

your idealised, we're in control of everything world. Anyway, I'm just an elderly earth scientist - what would I know? It's my kids and
grandkids I feel sorry for with governments taking the attitude that the present one is with this Bill.
The proposed bill is based on the premise that the science is settled and there need be no further scientific discussion to justify it.
That view is not held by many thousands of New Zealanders who have very valid scientific qualifications, who are well educated in

atmospheric physics and climate change matters and who have been monitoring the political dialogue on this issue for many years.
The minister has included statements on weather events in the introduction to the MfE conversation document regarding historical

climate change that are demonstrably incorrect. When questioned he declines to enter into any discussion on these statements. Let
me make it very clear, 'The science is not settled'. The economic impact on New Zealanders of this draconian legislation will be

immense, potentially destroying the livelihood of New Zealanders living in already damaged areas due to the political ideology of a
very small proportion of the population. The government does not have a mandate to force this legislation on the country. It must not
be allowed to proceed without a comprehensive explanation of the scientific evidence and economic impact and a binding

referendum agreeing to support it. A very large number of New Zealanders will not agree that this bill in any form be introduced to
Parliament and submitted for passage into law. The bill must not proceed.
We do not need a climate change commission - it is a waste of taxpayer money and part of a confidence trick against the populace.
Financial gain is pointless if we don't have a future to spend in - let's get this right for our kids... and their kids!
The economic cost of acting far outweighs the benefits as demonstrated by the modelling. As such the ideological imposition of the

bill will create a more adverse outcome than the effects it is seeking to mitigate (even if they are correct).
If I were to bet on a horse in a race with two mutated feet (ie climate modelling) I would be called stupid. This is what is intended to be
forced upon we the people. Offer a referendum on this in the next electoral process and let the people decided.
Your reports notes "The costs from climate change are already high and growing." So why further penalize New Zealanders (and it will

be mostly the poorest) to impress offshore unelected bureaucrats ? Why are you turning up the fear? NZ already uses mostly
renewable energy, has perhaps the worlds most efficient farming practices and an emissions output so low as to be negligible in

impact on the atmosphere. (and don't quote per-capita emissions output - those figures are a fiction- only total emissions count IF
you are serious about solving this over hyped issue - working on a per-captia basis suggests the issue is not at all pressing)

Fortunately, the modeled impacts of "Climate Change" are vastly over-hyped - and we do have far more pressing issues to deal with in
NZ right now. The Government should instead commit the billions that will be wasted in Climate Mitigation & Zero Carbon Target

administration to NZ' s Children's health, safety and education. All we have to do to combat Climate Change is take off the jersey and
walk inland slowly.
I am seriously concerned about the environmental damage being caused by things like deforestation and intensive farming. Things
like deforestation are actually causing weather pattern changes which are impacting us more than emissions. Also, we need to keep
a calm approach to things - extreme weather events are part of the history of our planet and not necessarily caused by emissions.
Focus on the meat and diary industries - 49% of greenhouse gas emissions come from agriculture, according to the Ministry for the

 Environment (April 2018). I would like to see New Zealanders encouraged to reduce the amount of meat and dairy they consume,
 which would also improve general health. Farmers could be encouraged to diversify and focus more on sustainable, plant-based
 protein sources. Young farmers could be encouraged/incentivized to go into horticulture rather than agriculture.




  
Climate Change is a global problem – it cannot be tackled by countries in isolation. New Zealand must demonstrate global leadership
and match its bold domestic emissions reduction agenda: by having an equally ambitious climate change strategy abroad. Access to

climate finance is a matter of climate justice – those who have contributed least to the causes of climate change are typically the
most vulnerable to its impacts and have the least resources to respond. We must take responsibility for our global emissions and the

climate impacts that we have contributed to. It’s very important that all New Zealanders have their say on how we make the shift to a
zero carbon future here in New Zealand but we must also help the world’s most vulnerable communities across the Pacific adjust to

the impacts on climate change. We must ensure that the Zero Carbon Bill is transparent. This means the bill must include a
requirement to produce annual reports about New Zealand’s international climate change contributions in order to ensure that the
Pacific countries get the support they need and can plan to adapt to their changing environment. Transparency in the Bill will promote

public engagement and political accountability. New Zealanders will be able to understand the international contributions we are
making and as a nation, we will be able to stand tall that we are supporting our Pacific neighbours adapt to their climate change reality.

New Zealand has demonstrated global leadership with our commitment to stopping oil and gas exploration – now let us continue that
moral leadership and include transparency in what and how we support climate change efforts abroad, particularly in the Pacific.
New Zealand has a great opportunity to lead in many areas, including adapting farming practices to a more sustainable model. This
could see a huge reduction in nitrate fertilizer application and drought resistant pasture, so no more irrigation which wastes millions

of gallons of precious water. Less nitrates means cleaner streams and rivers. Use of new feeds for cows can significantly reduce
methane emissions and the entire environment, both atmosphere and terrestrial can be vastly improved. Reforestation using native

trees as much as possible will greatly improve New Zealand's environment and start to restore the 'Clean Green' image. All these
changes along with a reduction in industrial and mechanical pollution will help to slow global warming and hopefully impact on the

increasingly chaotic climate changes.
Farm Shelterbelts and riparian plantings over 1Ha should be eligible for carbon credits. Height for all credits needs to be 4 metres
making manuka and riparian planting easier to comply
making any significant change requires public support with compliance rather than expecting government enforcement.
The whole climate change is an unbelievable con, the idea of carbon neutral by 2050 is absurd, it will neither change the climate or
assist in the growth of the living standards for all Kiwis
There is no conclusive evidence that there is manmade climate change only climate modeling that have only a few factors inputed to
give a desired result. Garbage in garbage out. You will wreck our economy if you continue with this foolishness.
Losing jobs and economic well-being hurts people. People should have priority over decreased emissions.
We need to be heavy handed. People are too selfish to take initiative and help the cause. We'll never make our targets if theres no

consequences set out. But while there are consequences, there should also be incentives and rewards to encourage change
across all of our emissions sectors. As an example I'd love it if the idea of getting a bank loan to buy a $20,000 EV was actually a

cheaper and more easily achievable long term option than owning a petrol vehicle for New Zealanders. Maybe the govt could work
with banks to provide lower interest rate loans for anyone buying an EV? No GST on EVs, while increasing GST on petrol cars to 30%.
Working with power companies to provide lower electricity rates for charging EVs at home etc.




 
I do hope for the sake of my small grandchildren that we will come together as a country to recognise the need to work as a team to

reduce our carbon footprints. Let us be an inspiration to our international ,global neighbours.
Please get on with it!
The proposal will reduce the standard of living of New Zealanders by 25%. This will be based on "settled science" predictions which
 have so far been wrong in respect of man made global warming, CO2 and their effect on the planet. The bill is complete folly.
I would like to see recognition by our legislators of the role of economic growth in bringing about climate change, and of the

importance of moving to a steady-state economy of sufficiency for all.
WE NEED TO FACE THE FACTS THAT: (1) Climate change mechanisms were well enough understood by scientists in the early 1980's
to correctly initiate the Kyoto Protocol; (2) Right wing climate change denialism has been spectacularly effective in blocking the

necessary emissions reductions from being implemented and as a result emissions have increased since the 1991 Kyoto Protocol
was agreed; (3) Irresponsible political management of the climate change issue and delayed action has substantially increased the

risks to humanity of catastrophic climate change impacts occurring; (4) Temperature changes associated with the Earth's energy
imbalance have been absorbed by the oceans and ice melt but will start to increase more rapidly as the oceans warm. There is a

material risk that climate change impacts will massively impact agricultural output leading to famine. Crop-growing and grazing land is
a delicate and very thin layer [only 50 cm thick] of the the ecosystem that is extremely vulnerable to minor climate change damage (
eg flooding, erosion, temperature change and drought ); (5) There is a real risk of sea level rises being dramatically larger or more

rapid (or both) than the "1-2 metres in the next 100 years" planning guidelines communicated by the NZ Government which are
intellectually dishonest in that they fail to state the true scale of sea level rises that could occur; (6) There is credible geological

evidence showing historical sea level rises of around 10 metres being associated with only a 1.0 degree C rise in atmospheric
temperatures. The Paris Accord only aims to limit temperature increase to 2.0 degrees C (maybe 1.5 degrees C). The associated

scale of sea level rise will result in massive destruction of valuable human-built infrastructure and significant inundation of low altitude
agricultural land. It is very likely that the Paris Accord targets are too soft. (7) The maximum potential for sea level rises of around 70
metres from ice melt would be enormously destructive to human society and economies as would sea level rises of only 10-20

metres; (8) Modern advanced societies depend on stability and the long term use of assets. New Zealand will never rationally be able
afford to rebuild Whangarei, Auckland, Tauranga, Hamilton, Palmerston North, Wellington, Christchurch, Dunedin, and Invercargill as a

result of sea level rise and inundation. Prevention will be cheaper than dealing with the consequences of climate change; (9) There is
credible scientific evidence for the existence of feedback processes that could swamp any ability for humanity to 'control' climate

change by emissions reductions and this should drive far greater urgency in our actions than has been evidence to date; AND
THEREFORE WE MUST ensure that New Zealand's climate change response truly reflects the real gravity of the climate change
problem. While we are a small country, leadership is a critical element of driving global progress. We must lead given the lack of global

progress. Finally, I strongly recommend that we consider the benefits of 'central bank funding mechanisms' that will enable rapid
progress to be made on critical projects ( eg wind farms, geothermal power stations, railway electrification, energy system upgrades,

public transport upgrades, research and development initiatives etc ) whilst allowing for the costs to be amortised across multiple
generations. The use of 'quantitative easing' has precedents globally to rescue the banking system. Saving the planet from human-

induced climate change is a far more worthy goal and will result in the sort of stability that financial markets, businesses and ordinary
people undeniably prefer.
Thanks for the opportunity to make a submission. Obviously a huge effort has been made so far. Keep up the good work and keep

communicatiing. There are a huge number of worried/frightened people out here. I am of the older generation (81) and I worry for my
grandchildren and their grandchildren too.
Engagement of the general public is critical. This issue is not just one for a political minority. Therefore we need education and media

(even advertising) to address populist perceptions. We need to be all-encompassing - addressing the difficult issues such as
methane emissions as well as the more obvious ones (like tree planting).
Revenue from carbon tax should be used to lower income tax and GST. The policy should be called the "carbon tax Cut" as in a

means by which New Zealanders who pollute less become better off.
There are so many easy things we should be ticking off. Target solar incentives in areas where fossil fuels are burned. More wind
energy. Incentives for farmer to plant forest on less productive land and even along side paddocks. Use prisons for tree nurseries

which would teach prisoners valuable life skills, Use community service to plant trees. Continue to tax fuel but make NZ an easy place
to buy electric cars. Speed up use of technology in cars so that driving on Motorways and highways is taken over by computers.

Traffic jams would be a thing of the past. Continue with Trams and electric trains but make sure they are a cheap alternative. We must
also try to move to a more circular economy with our waste. Allow travellers to NZ to offset their carbon foot print (Voluntarily) but it will
help show we are starting to live up to our 100% pure image. Stop farming in areas like the Mackenzie basin. I have no problem with

our farming industry if we can start to do it more sustainably.
Thank you to MfE for all the hard work they have put into the Bill and the consultation process.

No for now let's just focus on cutting emissions asap
I have been writing on zero emissions on my blog for some years. Below I submit the URL's with a short comment for each one. As I

said above, the government sometimes actually has to do things itself but at it's best, it sets the playing field; the rules, so that we do
the necessary. These article are very much predicated on this principle. 1) Demand Balancing of our electrical grid Traditionally power

companies have operated by supply balancing; bringing on new generation as the demand increases. Power companies must be
encouraged to use demand balancing; opening up new demand as base demand decreases. The best incentive for this is price but

the infrastructure must be in place so that you can automatically turn on various devices (such as car charging) as the price
decreases. http://mtkass.blogspot.com/2018/04/electrical-demand-balancing.html 2) Election financing The one ring that controls
them all is election financing. Who Pays the Piper Calls the Tune was never so true as with election financing. Vested interest

financing of political parties must cease completely. Otherwise we will never reach our goals of zero carbon.
http://mtkass.blogspot.com/2018/01/wasted-effort.html 3) Sorting Out Dairy Farms This doesn't mean reducing our dairy herd.

Dairying could become the darlings of the green movement. The devil is in the detail.
http://mtkass.blogspot.com/2018/01/mitigating-harm-dairy-causes-to.html 4) Sorting Out Farming For most of our (human) history we

have released carbon into the atmosphere from our soils adding to atmospheric Carbon Dioxide. This carbon could be returned to
the soil by correct farming while at the same tome markedly improving the bottom line of the farmers both in individual crop
production and reliability of crops. http://mtkass.blogspot.com/2018/01/conservation-agriculture.html 5) Our History Here is a book

review of the history of Humans destroying their soils and in doing so releasing carbon into the atmosphere. Here in New Zealand we
are continuing this destructive tradition. http://mtkass.blogspot.com/2017/11/dirt.html 6)Composting Barns Composting barns

ensure that any gas that goes off manure goes off as Carbon dioxide rather than as methane. Methane is a far more potent green
house gas than Carbon dioxide. There are many other benefits to the farmer. http://mtkass.blogspot.com/2017/10/composting-

barns.html 7)This is the Blockbuster David Montgomery has traveled all over the world observing farmers who have come up,
independently of each other, of a new/old way of farming. If adopted widely, a great deal of the carbon we have vented into the

atmosphere would be incorporated into the soil. This is a book review of one of his books. 8) The Ratchet Effect One of the doges
the power companies use to disadvantage the small solar power owner is what I call the Ratched Effect. If you want increased solar
installation by private households, this must not be allowed. http://mtkass.blogspot.com/2013/10/solar-power-and-ratchet.html

9)Making the Installation of Solar Electric Economically Feasible http://mtkass.blogspot.com/2013/06/net-metering.html 10) Another
one for Making Solar Electric Worthwhile http://mtkass.blogspot.com/2013/04/solar-electric-whats-missing.html 11) Charcoal Char

can be incorporated into the soil. It has no contained nutrients itself but fulfils a number of important functions in the soil besides
sequestering carbon for a very long period (charcoal is refractory). If plantation wood was built into long lasting structures and the

waste charred and put in our soils, we would be sequestering considerable carbon from the atmosphere.
http://mtkass.blogspot.com/2010/11/biochar.html 12) Mining Royalties and carbon reduction/sequestration Mining is a 'one-off'
When it is done it is done and won't come again. There is no justification for using the revenue from mining (coal, gold, iron etc etc)

for current consumption. It should be put into investments for the long term. The best of these would be to encourage carbon
reduction and sequestration for the future of our descendents. http://mtkass.blogspot.com/2010/10/mining-royalties-and-

renewable-energy.html 13) Other Benefits There are so many other benefits to taking the various measures that would address
climate change (zero carbon) that we could almost ignore climate change and take these measure just for their other benefits.

http://mtkass.blogspot.com/2010/10/forget-climate-change.html 14) Wind Farms Wind farms have got a bad rap in some quarters.
Much of this is Nimbi'ism but some may be justified. The government should work our (research) which is which to a) put the

nimbi'ism in it's place and if any concerns are justified, address them. http://mtkass.blogspot.com/2010/07/enabling-wind-farms.html
15) Electric Cars Clearly, our main source of carbon emissions is our fleet and the domestic fleet is most easily addressed. This blog
gives the benefits of increasing the uptake of electric cars and the ways it can be achieved.

http://mtkass.blogspot.com/2010/07/electric-cars-in-new-zealand-uptake-of.html 16) Jim Hansen Jim Hansen has proposed a way of
reducing carbon emissions. It is at the heart of the problem. It would compensate the public for any extra expense during the

transition (Actually the benefits both during and after the conversion to renewables are immense) Show courage and adopt his
suggestion. http://mtkass.blogspot.com/2009/12/jim-hansens-climate-change-solution.html 17) Legislation for Electric Cars Actually

this applies far beyond just electric cars. Government is at the best when it sets the scene and lets us get on with doing the
necessary. http://mtkass.blogspot.com/2009/11/legislation-for-electric-cars.html
I would urge those constructing legislation to consider the following when drafting the bill on carbon emissions. That just change be
the core principle of legislation and practice. Changes need to bear on all New Zealanders in balance to their means and needs. To

do anything other than equitably reward useful behaviour and control poor practices strikes at the very heart of our democracy. That
the commission, and public confidence, be protected. To protect the public confidence, it is necessary to use transparent processes

and create an entirely independent public watchdog, that has a legislated obligation to investigate and ‘whistle-blow’, when attempts
are made to subvert the commission’s work. That independence of thought and action is guaranteed. Governments change and so,
therefore, do priorities, policy and ways of working. Any commissioners or other body need to be independent of political and normal

administrative structures to remain apolitical. That there is a requirement to seek causes rather than symptoms. An illustrative
example: transport is a major carbon emitter. Shifting the vehicle fleet to electric vehicles merely treats a symptom, where being
prepared to remedy cause by redeveloping our cities to low-carbon, sustainable, more productive, more liveable forms. Working on

causes is much harder, but necessary. That our legislators and administrators not be proud. That it be mandated that advice be
actively sought from outside New Zealand on technologies and methods. We need to be able to learn from other people’s successes

and mistakes. That the wisdom of contrarian views are considered. Some caution is needed with some of the technologies becoming
available and a very critical assessment is vital. Being first with something like a heavy uptake in battery technology that might swiftly
be made obsolete by hydrogen-based energy storage would be very unwise. That courage be a requirement. The moral courage to

enact necessary measures that may be unpopular is going to be needed, as well as the practical ability to withstand the assaults of
special interest groups and changing government’s priorities. Both of those need to be somehow built in to legislation. That the

need for great change is accepted. The changes required have the potential to put New Zealand on what is effectively an emergency
footing and may, at times, require extraordinary measures. That plain speaking – in all languages - be required.




 
How we globally respond to the challenge of climate change over the next 30 years will impact every person in the world for
centuries. I believe that our current path is a result of tremendous shortsightedness and an abrogation of our responsibility to future

generations and to those who are affected by climate change today. A strong Zero Carbon Bill would a be a key step towards New
Zealand doing what it needs to to ensure a hospitable planet both within my lifetime and in the future.




 
Lessen dairy and beef stock.
household sufficiency is an aim that remediates emmissions through circular systems for household production, reducing waste and

optimising natural resources. solar is a part of this, and the commodification of soil for food production and carbon capture. total
recycling systems, and independance from large scale industry reduces waste and production emmissions. neighbourhood centers

are required to support microindustry by coordinating microeconomies, providing essential services and psychosocial support.
walkable communities reduce reliance on transport. data management systems provide a wealth of information across demographics
for the maintenance of natural infrastructure, and social outcomes. church and iwi organisations, libraries and education providers are

excellent existing host venues for neighbourhood centers. inclusion in council forums allows community members to participate in
planning committees, make group submissions, and vote in online referendums effecting national legislation.
this has to be the skewed piece of market research i have ever read. What a joke.
Carbon sequestration is of prime importance. eg. Making charcoal/biochar from biomass that would otherwise be wasted, and

returning it to the soil; Changing agricultural practices to achieve carbon sequestrations by changing to perenial pasture grasses;
Managed grazing, so that perenail grass roots draw down carbon in their roots when excess root mass is shed by the plants. Organic

agriculture, Silvopasture. These are just some of the ways carbon can be sequestered. See the book "Drawdown" Edited by Paul
Hawken for more ways.
Feedback from stakeholders is important.
Really appreciate the pro active way that engagement on this issue is being handled - congratulations
Planting forestry in places where there was once thriving communities not only destroys communities as their is only minimal
employment and land owners will need to eat for the 25 years it takes to grow the trees also the destruction of the environment from
tree waste and truck damage to roads is expensive. The food that is no longer grown by sheep and beef farmers will still be grown in

the world to feed our increasing world population and therefore their is no net world gain by reducing our emissions produced by
growing sheep and beef a high protein grass based product grown by some of the most efficient producers in the world. This is

illogical because it doesn't reduce world emissions.
Climate change is really the seasons of the year and weather happens every year and its been a scam for years and people should
be allowed to say this the questions are not set correctly.
My research is fairly important if the goal is to actually halt climate change in it's tracks
NZ could be a world leader in adapting to climate change. We could be implementing solar panels on all public buildings, reducing our

power need nationwide, we could be investing in public transport in our cities, making cars an unaffordable luxury. We could improve
working conditions so those who could work from home, do so, reducing the need for a daily commute. The greening of public

buildings and open spaces would mitigate our pollution, the improvement in our recycling would reduce our need for new raw
materials. We need to become more self-sufficient, Community gardens a must-have, fruit trees grown in public spaces,
encouragement of vegetable gardens for all who want to grow their own.




 
Should apply to anyone owning or managing significant or critical infrastructure.
Thanks for your very important work! NZ is such a beautiful country which should be able to be enjoyed by many generations to

come.
Provided these adaptations aren’t counterproductive in terms of the use of our environments or resources.
We won't restrict our way out of this problem, only create and grow our way out. Don't pass a restrictive bil that hinders our eventual
adaptation and success. A strong economy is paramount.
I am excited by the setting up of the Commission, and the zero-carbon bill. Done well, we have the opportunity to make a real
difference to the future of NZ and the world, in the face of the biggest challenge humanity has ever faced. I have just participated in

the first Lead Author meeting for the 6th Assessment Report of the IPCC, and I am reminded strongly of the stakes, the level of
commitment already at play, and the urgency of action.
The combination of rapid sea level rise, warming and acidification of the oceans and changing weather patterns all coming together

will adversely alter our way of life and we need to be prepared to protect our people.
Don't think that central government should have responsibility for the detailed adaptation planning for the whole country. Having a

hierarchy guided by central government would be more useful by providing strong guidance while allowing for a measure of variation
to suit local contexts and distributing some of the administrative load. Will be most successful if central government also provides a
supporting role empowering local government to effectively plan within the guidance, priorities etc. laid out by central government.
Please don't let agriculture avoid their responsibilities. We cannot allow agriculture to pollute without the same restraints put on the
rest of industry and keep face on an international level.
Be ambitious. We're in a situation where "incremental" changes are not good enough. Go big or go home.




 
Not for the moment.
A just transition means that a monetary system for allocating emmissions to the rich based on their ability to pay is unjust. Just as rich

cant litter more than a poor person, nor should they be able to emit more as an individual. Therefore rationing systems rather than
auction systems should be put in place. Consideration should be given to the fact that it is the rich who have put the existing CO2 up

there in the atmosphere. It is clearly unjust that the poor equally pay to remove the CO2, and that the rich do not pay for the damage
ALREADY caused. We need to use our trading relationships to penalise or stop trade with countries which are not part of the Paris

agreement or are making no progress on reducing emmissions.
This is an urgent matter for the goble - NZ is a prime position to be a world leader in zero emitions - it is the ONLY WAY FORWARD
Just to reiterate the importance of Regenerative Farming to our climate adaptation plans. this whole area is currently missing from

government & climate change commission’s thinking. In Tai Tokerau we are setting up a climate change trust and regenerative
farming is one of our key approaches for tackling climate change for the region. We have people available to talk to the CC

Commission about the value of taking a regenerative farming approach for NZ, as well as farms to see this in action.
Please note my answer to question 10. At present a lot (most) of the funding for agricultural mitigation and adaptation is coming from

the two big fertiliser companies, whose profit is being made from selling products which are ruining our soils, growing less pasture
than in the 1980s, and leaching hugely into our waters. Until someone is prepared to think outside this system, and fund testing for

what may well be natural alternatives, progress in agriculture will be painfully slow.
I have separately submitted a more detailed submission that will amplify my comments herein.
The advice or legal clarification around LIMs , PIMs is needed . ( NOT Crown Law)
Re-Plant forests (native, not introduced species), do more to save what little we've got left after nearly two centuries of decimating
this country. Stop destroying our waterways and natural environments for big business and start REALLY thinking about the future!!! I

do not wish my name to be published or my comments be posted on any websites, as I am not a climate-change expert and these
are my (reasonably informed but not expert) opinions.




 
Finding carbon sinks is vital - we need a national campaign to promote planting trees/leafy gardens/valuing & not chopping down
mature trees




 
Man made climate change is nonsense, however no one will take any notice of these submissions, their minds are already made up.
They will be proved absolutely wrong in time. By then it may be too late
Reiterating the need to make the policy mandatory and not optional immediately in 2018. Also provide addition funding to each DHB

Please listen to the people of Aotearoa. I am trying to parent my child, nurse sick patients and follow my own dreams, while every day
my heart is breaking when fearing for the health of my community, the condition of our beautiful and precious planet and the state of

our sacred waters. I work very hard, and for long hours and then am reduced to tears while walking down the aisles of the
supermarket. Because I feel guilty for every single product I buy that I cannot afford/do not have the time to source elsewhere, that
may be contributing to the demise of our environment. I am tired of plastic and oil being the ruling powers of our times. It is

exhausting, when you care, to be faced with endless arguments about economics, convenience, capital and freedom to profit. These
things will never matter as much as our air, land and water. The health of our souls, minds and bodies. No wonder we are in a state of

mental crisis. We cannot keep ignoring this problem. Thank you so much for creating this stepping stone, and may it be honoured
with enough detail and integrity to prevent it becoming lip service and box ticking.




 
I thought that there was supposed to a DISCUSSION, but in fact we are required to accept the Minister is correct - CO2 Emissions are
the cause of all our problems - and only discuss how far are we prepared to go to restrict its release to atmosphere. I think the

discussion needs to start a few steps earlier before we start to close down our economy!!!!!. I also think that all citizens need be
given real data, not subjective ideology and alarmist statements, so that they are able to endorse or discard the shrinking of our

economy by way of binding referendum. At the very least, they need to have a clear picture of what life in our country will look like with
the withdrawal hydrocarbons [the most cost efficient and concentrated source of energy currently available to humanity], and a clear

plan on how this energy source will be replaced given that: 1. wind and solar energy require more energy and resources to
manufacture than they are able to generate [ask Germany and Scandinavia who have said that these scources cannot replace
hydrocarbons]; 2. Nuclear energy is currently denied to New Zealanders by current legislation; and 3. Hydro energy resources are all-

but at maximum capacity. How any Government could deliberately commit its population to a reducing standard of living is difficult to
comprehend. It is time to STOP treating CO2 as a pollutant - it is not. ASK ANY PLANT!
In healthcare we know from studies that around 60% of our environmental impact and carbon footprint is from procurement. I am
almost certain that most households around the country are the same. It is easy to measure CO2e from our transport, energy etc -

these are the low lying fruits, but unfortunately only account for (at best) half of our emissions. Our clothes, chemicals, household
appliances, the things we consume of a daily basis without thinking probably make up the other half (or 2/3) of our true

environmental impact. As most of these things in NZ are imported from elsewhere but 'consumed' in NZ we need to make sure that
these are included in our calculations. I do not think currently that they are (other than perhaps their transport. This is depressing for
2 reasons. 1 - our job already seems daunting enough, the realisation that our CO2e is perhaps twice as large as we think makes the

task so much bigger. 2 measuring this is near impossible, it will require a full lifecycle analysis of all products imported to NZ. IF we are
serious about being truely carbon neutral rather that fudging the numbers on paper then this is what we NEED to do. We must

include healthcare in our calculations. Anaesthetic waste gasses make up a significant proportion of healthcare CO2e but are not
included in the government calculations. The anaesthetic gases from our 6 theirs last year were equivalent to the annual emissions

from 70 family cars... Finally I feel strongly that 'sustainability' is the key. sometimes focusing only on one strand of this (carbon
neutrality) can be detrimental to the environment in a number of other ways and NOT be sustainable. Geothermal electricity and its
impact of fresh water ways is a good example of this. We need to aggressively chase down our carbon targets but we also need to

focus on the wider issues of 'sustainability' for our country and our planet.
Local government should be a key part of this




 
It is important that the zero carbon target is firmly embeded in our legislations. The biggest risk would be that a new incoming

government can water down the act in the futre. The experience we have had with the Emissions Trading Scheme should be a
reminder to us all that futuer governments may not agree with the bill or targets. The level to which these can be changed should

therefore be well defined within the legislation.



 
NO.
I want to see real change - not just lip service.....this requires adequate funding and priority. Central government must help local

councils with funding. I would also like to see central government putting funding and tax cuts to individual householders who instal
solar and who switch to EVs.......this has to be supported by central government....please




 
Greater co-operation between the CRI's needs to be encouraged. At the moment they compete with each other for funding and
projects, resulting in negative outcomes. The roles and needs of the country for NIWA and Manaaki Whenua should be considered.
Once again, the legislation must have teeth and not be something that can be pushed aside by the next government. There must be
consistency. We can not afford the back and forth that we have had since National pushed aside Simon Upton. We cannot have this

be a political football. We must be united. Furthermore, we need to communicate to the public that the government will need to use
tax money to help industry and individuals transition. To some, this will sound like socialism and there may be push back. However,

we all pay taxes to be used for the greater good and they should be used to help NZ as a whole to transition. Whether that means
helping the dairy industry to kick coal, or if it means helping a poor west coast community to transition or poor families to retrain; then

so be it!
You cannot please all the people all of the time. Many people and groups will be unhappy with this Act, but it is essential that this
government pushes ahead with it as quickly as possible. At the time that motor cars were gradually being introduced, if governments

had been swayed by blacksmiths, farriers, vets, makers of horseshoes, saddles and riding equipment and clothes, we would still be
driving around in a pony and trap. Those people eventually accepted and adapted, even though at the time they hated those

responsible for introducing motorised transport. We must have the same strength of purpose.
The farmer representation group must include farmers who have experience of biological farming and the scientific background to
explain and demonstrate it. Prof Christine Jones and Dr Beverly Trowbridge would be a good start.
I'm excited to see this happening and I appreciate the effort that is going into consultations such as the public meeting I attended in

Invercargill. I feel proud to be a citizen of New Zealand and I'm so pleased to see our new government acting so quickly and
confidently on this issue. Thank you for the opportunity to participate.




 
I am a qualified New Zealand lawyer with a Masters Degree in Environmental and Energy Law from New York University. I am 27 years
old and will see substantial impacts of climate change in my lifetime. I think it is important that in addition to setting targets and plans,

New Zealand indicates its real present commitment to taking action on climate change, by introducing a functional price on carbon. A
Zero Carbon Act could be passed to include a set of current policies to help reduce emissions straight away, and the credibility of the

law would be boosted if we saw action being taken right away.



 
I am appalled at the misinformation that surrounds 'climate change'. Those who promulgate the illusion most are those who know
least about it - ie the Green Party. I have looked at their academic credentials - note one Green MP has any science background at all.

Those scientists who claim to know about climate change tend to cherry-pick their data because being a climate-change believer is a
guarantee of funding.
Thank you for the opportunity to provide feedback. As outlined above, I would again like to highlight that the Zero Carbon Bill is a
unique opportunity to ensure that we contribute to a positive future in developing countries who are among the most vulnerable to

impacts such as changing weather patterns and sea level rise. As such, the Bill should include strong references to New Zealand's
international commitments under the Sustainable Development Goals and the Paris Agreement, notably Articles 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11 on

developed country support to developing countries, particularly in the area of adaptation. The Climate Commission could play a key
role in monitoring and strengthening our contributions in the global fight against climate change. A national adaptation plan could
include policy guidance on our adaptation support overseas. In short, please ensure the Zero Carbon Bill will not only drive

meaningful climate action at home but also across the developing world.
Having spent my 20s living in Kenya where the average energy consumption was 0.5 barrels of oil per year (energy equivalent) and

my 30s in California where people were 90 times as consumptive I am aware of just how far from a sustainable base line we are. As an
Ocean Engineer and Marine Warranty Surveyor I spent the 90s overseeing the installation of very large offshore oil and gas facilities
including Hibernia and those of the North Dome field offshore Qatar. I moved to New Zealand looking for a more balanced and

sustainable lifestyle for myself and my family. But, apart from the low ratio of people to the environment have not found it here. New
Zealand is in a unique position of being able to use its low population and isolated ecosystem to lead the world in alternative

sustainable living. Whether it chooses to do so remains to be seen. However, I believe like the rest of the world it will soon have little
choice.
I'd like to see a few things: 1. Coal fire plants shutdown as of now (both power and other uses). Including Huntly, including Fonterra

milk drying plants! 2. Wood fire heating systems removed. No new should be sold. (winter emissions are caused by those) 3. Coal
burner heating systems removed. 4. Our current buses by no means reduce emissions. They are both extremely dirty both inside the

bus (you can smell the gases inside) and outside. Can't see how they are better than me riding in a self driving electric car (which is
probably done deal in 1-2 years). 5. I sincerely think that leading the way will do good for the planet and for our economy, the

technology solutions we are going to create is going to create far better GDP growth than predicted. 6. Regarding electricity markets
make a very simple change like Germany did: renewable energy takes priority. Renewable excludes bio energy, which has harmful
emissions. Consider that only solar and wind are 0 emission. Both geothermal and hydro are NOT 0 emission, there is no direct

emssions, though secondary emissions from biological processes (eg. bio build up in front of dams) need to be considered. Feel free
to contact me for pointers, but you'll find this in the scientific literature. 7. Take examples from Germany, they are leading the way of

transformation. 8. Develop an increased market incentive to promote electric cars.
In my view climate change is the most pressing issue of our lifetimes. We must take decisive and radical action, and soon.
Yes - see my comments in section 15.
This could help the government understand implications of climate change decisions, but many changes will need to happen despite
concerns avout them
Do not sacrifice our national economy for the virtue-signalling changes proposed. There is too much doubt about the relationship of
CO2 to 'climate change', NZ's total emissions are so small as not to make any difference to the global emissions budget, and our own

emissions do not effect our own climate as they blow away. If we really want to have a nuclear moment, perhaps we should consider
admitting that CO2 is not pollution, and has such a tiny effect on climate that we should just accept the cost of adjusting and
adapting as a cheaper and better return on our investment.
This Act needs to provide the Commission with a strong and central role and must have all powers necessary to hold government
(and potentially commercial players, through reporting requirements) to account. It should be able to commission its own research

and seek information from the government.
What a waste of time and money this survey is. Based n the new religion of global warming, morphing in to climate change when the
warming didn’t happen.
1). I am fully in support of a transition away from individual vehicles, particularly in cities, but this must be supported by a significant
investment in public transport infrastructure. 2) For decades we have heard for about the need to exempt farmers (animal agriculture)

from emission trading schemes. New Zealand prides itself on being innovative. The number-8-wire response to climate change and
emission reductions will not be had through the development of vaccines that inhibit ruminant methane emissions. It will be through

developing clean alternatives to meat, wool and dairy. The movement away from the consumption of animal products and the
adoption of plant-based diets and textiles, is the biggest social shift of our time. Innovators have responded to this - lab grown meat
has already been developed. Lab grown dairy products will likely follow. New Zealand can innovate to meet new market demands, and

could be a world leader in the organic sector (which might also make our 100% Pure brand more honest, unlike the uncomfortable
misrepresentation that it is today). We can do this. We MUST do this.
This is a thoroughly bad proposal. Its benefits and risks are neither identified nor quantified. There is no single tangible benefit that
could not be achieved at a fraction of the cost of this Bill
I am concerned that NZ will become unaffordable for New Zealanders as energy, transport, and other sectors will see costs go up.
Then employment will suffer due to the manufacturing and production areas of our economy, especially agriculture, will see their
costs go up as well. Retail is not a economic activity that signals the health of the economy. Hoping and suggesting that technology

innovation will compensate for other emissions heavy sectors cost increases is difficult to see for NZ. Rather let market forces
determine that outcome.
I have been a Forest and Bird member for 40 years and am an active supporter of Tawharanui Open Sanctuary. I love tramping and

have recently tramped 300kms of the Te Araroa trail. I am involved in a very progressive local community garden. As a member of
Transition Towns Pt Chevalier I am actively involved in activities with the group to support sustainable living practices. I also feel we as

a wealthy country must address some of the excessive damage we have created to climate change that is affecting our Pacific Island
neighbours who are suffering the most and have been minimal emitters. It is because of these interests and social concerns and my

concern for the planet and for future generations that I fully support the Green Party in its aim to pass the Zero Carbon Act as
proposed.
I thank the NZ Government for putting this extremely important issue on the national agenda, and I hope this bill is passed without

obstruction.




 
I'm happy to be contacted about any of this. Currently I've had many discussions with the Environmental Manager for the Otago

region irrigation company about how things can change, one of these changes is going to the board now. I am also on a Resiliant
Community Board. We can set President's cases that show how things can change. We can learn from other's. We can learn from our

community and I think it's essential that we work within our community and support our community so we are all collaborating
towards the same cause and supporting each other within this and towards better solutions. The comments about the irrigation

company are currently being put to the board, so please hold them confidential as they may currently be sensitive information.
However I do think translucency aids support so perhaps soon in the future this information can be released and if it sets a
presidents case, in fact, promoted. But that time is not right now. If you contact me I can keep you up to date with this as if it

becomes a president's case I believe it needs as much support and media and publicity as possible, both to show the way we are
working together for a better future and to align with the industries to create a not just sustainable future, but one where we are

actually fixing what we've damaged in the past. (e.g. our waterways, which is not just health, but respect to Iwi, Culture, Health,
Environment.... many elements.) We can be a leader with respect to changing things for the better. We have the "kiwi" mentality of

making things happen and being innovative. Let's work together to make this Country 100% Pure again!
Not at the moment.
As entomologist working independently in the Far North of New Zealand I have been monitoring insects in the warmest part of New

Zealand since 1999. Insects are regulated by temperature so are ideal indicators of climate change. I can report that since its arrival
in 1999 the Tropical grass webworm, Herpetogramma licasisalis, has not spread further south of Kaitaia, despite its food source

kikuyu grass extending throughout Northland as far south as coastal Horowhenua. As its name suggests this is a tropical insect
which is at the limit of its distribution in New Zealand north of Kaitaia. In 20 years climate has not warmed sufficiently for this insect to

extend its range (Dymock et al. 2009. Proceedings of the New Zealand Grasslands Association 71: 25-30). I am currently working on
distribution changes of a range of key insect indicators of climate change.
Specifically to repeal urgently Sections 70A and B of the RMA which gives the Regional Councils ability to do nothing. Replace with a
requirement for Regional Councils to consider Greenhouse gases as a pollutant and consider in there air plans. They need direction

or they will continue to do nothing. Require any removal of coal etc to pass the test for alternatives means,Electricity and heating have
viable alternatives, cement and steel are not see well off.
I am concerned that the Zero Carbon Act will not be resilient against powerful lobby groups. The existing oil and gas sector, the dairy
industry, farming in general, the automotive industry and the big players in the electricity sector will all try to water down and slow

down the necessary action that we need to take. I am also concerned that international trade agreements may also slow down
progress. It is important that the positive opportunities that arise from addressing climate change and the moral obligation to do so

are highlighted. If we delay action it will be far more expensive and we will be less likely to succeed. I believe that all effort needs to be
done to get agreement across all sectors of business and the community if this is going to work.




 
Provide a commercial overview of proposed actions stated in the bill. Currently the lack of substantiation undermines the validity of
the govenrment proposals.
Resourcing must be made available to support regulatory efforts.
I strongly believe that behavior change is critical to progress towards net carbon zero. Encouragement, advice and implementation
need to be applied as widely, effectively, and as soon as possible.
This summer I was aware of a variety of sea shells on the shore. I marvelled at the intricacy and beauty of these natural treasures.

Later I learned that the water temperature was causing the shell fish to die. How depressing! It made me wonder what species we will
lose to global warming. I hope it is not too late to save the inhabitants of our waters and lands. They are truly taonga. I hope New

Zealand will live up to its pure reputation, which it does not currently deserve.
The work we all need to do to adapt to climate change is work that is best shared by the whole country. Having a clear plan at a
country-wide level helps share the costs and expertise required in planning for the changes we have coming.
Climate change signature in New Zealand is not strong to date. Auckland Airport long term average temperatures show approximately
0.5 degree increase in 50 years - and some of that could be related to increased aircraft frequency and surrounding urban

development which has elsewhere been noted to affect temperature observations. Over a similar period, Christchurch shows zero
net average temperature change. Average wind speeds, and number of stormy days has not increased at those locations either. So

maybe there is worse to come already loaded in the system with historical global emissions - that might be the case although I
believe that the alarmists and doomsayers vastly overstate this threat. One only has to review the ridiculous predictions of James
Hansen, Al Gore and other alarmists in the 1990's and early 2000's - none of those misleading prognostications have come to pass.

However even if worse is to come, nothing in this proposal will affect any of that one iota. So if anything focus only on those initiatives
where emission reductions can be shown to have a net economic benefit (or at worst neutral) within a short to medium time frame (3

- 5 years) - encouragement for an electric vehicle fleet may be applicable for example. Also focus on adaption where necessary. Don't
let the utopian planners get their hands on lots of cash.

Just as Kyoto proved to be a scam, so too is the Paris Accord. How many time does the bias of the IPCC and the environmental media

need to be exposed before this stops? How many more doomsday models need to be proven far from perceptive before this stops.
The establishment of a Climate Czar will do nothing to mitigate climate change. Climate change has always happened and always will.

No scientist can accurately measure the amount of effect people have on the atmosphere. Theories fed to us are always speculative,
drastic and innacurate. This proposition will have a negative effect on the people of New Zealnd. Most of all on the poor, and for what?

A bumch of unfounded predictions made by corrupt scientists propogated by a biased media and enforced by a tyrannical
government. F off with this bollocks.
Please do not post my name, address, or email address on any website, document or publicly accessible site. Happy for the
submission contents to be public.




 
I would like to see the New Zealand Government's open recognition that the world's climate has always changed, and that there is
still no verifiable scientific proof that mankind has an ability to influence the normal climate change patterns to any significance. The

climate has changed significantly in the geologically recent past, without mankind's inputs. Hence in the absence of scientifically
verifiable proof that mankind can affect the earth's climate, spending trillions of Dollars to attain something which is fraught with
uncertainty and many vested interest groups without a public referendum is premature. There are numerous examples of deliberate

scientific fraud perpetrated to alarm ordinary citizens about climate change, for instance by alarmist proponents like Mr Al Gore. There
is far too much alarmism which in many cases is driven by funding models that many scientists have come to rely on to pursue their

interests. True science is never settled ( https://www.wsj.com/articles/climate-science-is-not-settled-1411143565 ), and the vitriol by
many of these alarmist scientists, such as the recently convicted fraudster Michael Mann of infamous hockey stick fraud, and Al

Gore's "you can do this at home" fraud clearly show that real science is being stifled and denied. Name calling by alarmists does
nothing to further true science, and labels like "climate denier" is a reflection of an inability to grasp the inconvenient reality that no
scientist has ever claimed the climate doesn't change. Climate has always changed, and will continue to do so driven by elements

completely out of the control of mankind. To name a few : The sun, the earth's orbital changes, volcanoes under the sea and above
the sea, and catastrophic events like significant sized meteorite impacts. None of these can be influenced by any spending by any

government. Instead of wasting trillions of Dollars on chasing ghosts, there ought to be a focus on expenditure which benefits
mankind in significant areas such as health, food production, poverty alleviation, and peace.




 
PLEASE make this bill happen asap. I am deeply concerned about climate change. We must act now before our beautiful world
unravels.
Refrigerants - New Zealand’s Climate Denial. Small amounts but significant due to potency. Example of legislation nobody paying

attention to. If we are to reduce greenhouse gases why in NZ so poor on refrigerants? The irony of people wringing their hands over
emissions yet nobody seems concerned over the fridge unless it fails to keep the chardy cool. When it fails the fridge is dumped,

gases released. Yes, yes there is a law that says such gases are not to be released into the atmosphere but like so many
environmental laws in NZ, few pay attention. (Even councils regularly flout the Reserves Act.) For if there is no enforcement it is as

good as no law at all. So let’s forget about announcing the edicts that cause no change and actually figure out a way to stop
refrigerants being released from discarded fridges, air conditioning units, dehumidifiers, heat pumps etc At present companies that
run transfer stations allow the dumping of fridges into scrap metal piles. They ask that they are dumped on condition that they have

been ‘de-gassed’. For a start that is not always checked and if it is, and found intact, the dumper is asked to de-gas. The most
common response is the dumper to simply cut the refrigerant line. The company running the transfer station then can claim it is the

responsibility of the dumper and wash their hands but it results in the same thing. It is free to dump a fridge as the metal is recycled.
The dump operator gets free metal out of the deal. Fridges make up a very large proportion of that scrap metal pile. Perhaps the

answer is to require transfer station operators to have a role in recycling the gases and for the polluter to pay. To dump a fridge with
gas will cost something to recover that gas but it should cost significantly more to dump a fridge with the refrigerant line cut. Yes,
there are refrigeration companies that de-gas fridges but it has been known that people pay for such a service only to discover the

company has simply snipped the line out of convenience. All fridges etc end up at the dump so why not concentrate recovery there?
How to get transfer station operators, that to me seem very disinterested in recycling, to carry out recovery? The pit seems cheaper

and more convenient for so much waste. I fear it might have to be a case of forcing operators to have a system in place that can
easily be monitored and audited if they want fridge metal. Will this result in them not accepting items at all and promote fly tipping?
Least then it will be an issue that is open as opposed to what exists in NZ now which is a total denial. I brought a dehumidifier the

other day but nowhere on the machine or in the manual did it list the refrigerant. So obviously the manufacturer doesn’t even think
the gas will be recycled. The store selling me the dehumidifier had no idea. An end of life recovery bounty system financed at the

point of sale would have worked here. But we really don’t care. We say we do, but it’s like buying a plastic dolphin to show how much
you care about the sea. There is a connection in people’s head but not in reality. Fridge dumping really does seem an issue we have

seriously overlooked in the plethora of Climate Change mission statements. I look forward to the day NZ gets real on hazardous
materials (well behind the OECD on that) and actually monitors what we are doing as a country. Choosing to take a bag to the
supermarket is not going to do it. Please consider gases used in rolling out more heat pumps etc. What is the end point?
While the 2050 date and the idea of staged five year emission budgets might convey a calm, considered process we need to keep in
mind that right now in almost any given week in New Zealand we have housing, infrastructure and agricultural output being destroyed

by weather related cold, drought, flooding and wind with invasive species being enabled and diseases spreading. What we might plan
at our pace within our considerations of GDP and 'political reality' actually has no relation to the speed at which the climate is
changing and the impacts are appearing. To do anything less than put into legislation the most ambitious emissions reductions we

can is to lose any chance of getting ahead of the pace of the changes we've already started. We throw not only caution to the wind,
but the basis of our civilisation.
Should have paid more attention to the science 50 years ago. Good luck with saving Gaia.
It won’t hurt us all that much, will it? An Island in the middle of a big ocean? All the effects will be buffered by the ocean, won’t they?
Yup. Likely true for, though a lot of our infrastructure will end up underwater... in 100 years or so. Yet there is another inconvenient

truth that New Zealand is blind to. A devastatingly “inconvenient truth” that will be more serious for NZ than most places and will
arrive sooner. As the climate starts to unravel, and delivers regular shocks to the economic system, (very likely by 2030, certain by

2035) the cost of CO2 will be forced above $100 per tonne. That’s a generational change, a recognition of peril, and a shift that will
affect the whole world. There is no "free trade". There is no "free". At that level the price of fuel for shipping triples, the cost of
shipping doubles, and our trade IS LESS THAN HALF ITS PREVIOUS LEVELS.!!! At their best the “free trade” agreements give us a 1 or

2% incremental increase. Cutting trade in half isn’t thinkable here in NZ Yet it WILL HAPPEN! Whether we choose to prepare or not,
climate destabilization will affect trade and it will affect OUR trade more than anyone else’s because... ...we are further from

everywhere than anyone else is. When we export wood and import wood furniture, we have damaged our economy and the
environment. The benefit of the “cheaper” furniture does not offset the long term damage. When we export Apples and import

Applesauce, we have damaged the economy and the environment just the same. When we allow industry to depend on foreign
suppliers of critical components, foreign suppliers at risk of failing as climate worsens, we damage our national security. Ricardo

never, in spite of the blunders in his treatise on "comparative advantage" pushed the notion that is common knowledge in New
Zealand today, that we should ONLY make the things we are good at. We can't afford to continue to believe that. The most important
and difficult change? We have to change our minds. This is the LEAST step we can take, and it needs to be taken now.
for Petes sake, stop this BS, bin the Bill.
note am totally negative with this BILL................bin it and quick, enough rubbish been printed and fallen out of left and so called
center right propaganda mouths...
As I have alluded to above, my main concern is that any new rules implemented are going to be focused on the Agriculture industry. I
realise the contribution agri has to our GHG emissions however given the reliance we have on the Agri sector in terms of our GDP,

this has to be expected. Comparing this to other countries is unhelpful as other countries don't have the reliance on commodity
exports like New Zealand does. In the Appendix of the Consultation document under agriculture is states that land use change to

lower emitting uses will likely be needed to achieve material emissions reductions from agriculture. I find this worrying and hope that
no farmer will be forced to change their system. Sure, if there is voluntary land use change that is fine, however forcing reductions
through capping cow numbers etc should not be an option. I know I have stated that I believe too high a reliance is placed on the

planting of trees however this is a key part of reaching our targets. In the appendix under forestry is states that "forestry helps buy us
time until other technological developments or option become available". This already sounds like a Band-Aid solution to a problem.

However, farmers should be able to use techniques such as planting areas and retiring areas as a means of mitigating their
emissions.
Organisations should have to be transparent about how they affect environmental issues, and the public ought to be able to
understand the impacts of their products/services etc.




 
Just to reiterate that our priorities need to change away from selfish consummerism and "jobs now" towards more life affirming ones,

caring for each other and looking after the environment for our children and grandchildren. To this end a universal basic income
would help to achieve equality and free people to do the environmental work that will need to be done.
A Zero Carbon Act is important to me because I want my children to know what fish tastes like, live in an environment where food is
not scarce, and where they don't have to fight for food or water to survive. I want my kids to know we did everything we could to avoid

climate change, which is irreversible and brings with it a huge burden of adaptation (mostly for our food supply and delicate
ecosystem which has never experienced such a speed of change). The impacts of climate change cannot be un-done, and become

exponential over time. A couple of degrees is too much for earth to sustain our current lifestyle. We are already experiencing 1
degree warmer temperature (vs pre-industrial levels) with another degree likely to be ‘baked in’. This may seem small, but there was
only a 3 degree average temperature change in the central point between the ice ages and Jurassic period. I realise NZ relies heavily

on the dairy industry for our GDP, but we are a smart and resourceful nation. With the right incentives and clear direction we will be
able to mititgate Methane or diversify our land use while still maintaining a strong economy. This will only happen with clear direction

from the government – clarifying our commitment to be net zero on emissions. It’s great all Kiwis have the opportunity to input to this
decision, however – I hope the specialists in this area make the final decision smartly. Most kiwis do not have the time/energy to read

all the research and understand the significance and urgency of the changes needed. We need the current government to make the
right decision for us in the long-term. You are the ones that have the information and have the opportunity now to make a significant
change. Hopefully the bravest decision is made. There may not be another opportunity for this government to show it is bold and

brave and putting the long term health of kiwis first. Also - If the Government sets a 2050 target now, it should set the most ambitious
target: reducing total greenhouse gases to net zero by 2050. If you are wanting to treat short-term and long-term gasses differently.

Then surely you should also treat gasses that are more-potent (and heat up the planet more) differently to those that are less-
potent. For example, Methane heats up the planet 25 times more than Carbon Dioxide. Nitrous Oxide heats up the planet 298 times

more than Carbon dioxide. Why would you consider length of time but not potency? 1) We must include Methane in the target:
Methane heats up the planet 25 times more than Carbon Dioxide*. Methane only lasts in the atmosphere for 12 years (instead of

CO2 which lasts for hundreds or thousands). But if the objective is to minimise/reduce climate change, we should look at alternatives
to reduce methane quickly. We can't afford to continue Methane emissions at current levels as they are the most damaging in the
short-term - which is the critical time. We have a booming dairy industry, but that industry is contributing towards the natural weather

catastrophes that will end up causing it to fail. It would be better to be pro-active now and deploy ways to mitigate the impact of
Methane. Some may argue NZ is a small % of global emissions (0.17%). This is true, but NZ is seen globally as a test market and if we
can demonstrate to the world how we can reduce emissions from Agriculture, then bigger markets (with more global impact) will

follow. We need to lead with a bold and brave ambition and actions. 2) Mitigate Methane in Agriculture using: a. Anaerobic Digestion -
which enables farmers to convert methane into biomethane which can be used as a renewable energy source for fuel, heating,

electricity etc. This is successfully used in UK and other markets. b. Methane inhibitors to reduce/delete methane from livestock.
There has already been good movement forward in this area in NZ, but we need to move faster. Can we increase funding to speed
up research results and make commercial Methane inhibitors available more widely as well as education. 3) We must include Nitrous

Oxide in the target. Nitrous Oxide heats up the planet 298 times more than Carbon Dioxide*. 4) Mitigate Nitrous Oxide in Agriculture
using: a. Gibberellins, natural hormones that stimulate plant growth and could be used in pastures instead of nitrogen fertiliser (which

currently creates nitrous oxide emissions). 5) Diversity land use from dairy to horticulture or other uses. 6) Off-set overall emissions by
planting more trees. *Source: Our atmosphere and climate 2017 report. Ministry for the Environment, Stats NZ, and data providers,

Climate change is the most pressing issue of our time. We should take purposeful and effective action to make a difference. While
challenging, there are also opportunities for New Zealand us to develop constructively for a better world.
For the adaptation plan to be successful all available knowledge must be integrated, including that which is currently withheld by
organisations.
Most plastics, industrialised dairy/meat production, dependence on private transport, freshwater damage and export are all

completely unnecessary. The pain of transition is nothing compared to the gain (or at least retention) of more important things like air,
water, housing security and health.
We have been studying this subject for years ( I have a Degree and Grad Dip (Massey 2006) and 70yrs of experience. We recently identified the onset of the current 'Quiet Sun' period and

anticipate the current cooling phase to last at least 20yrs more. In the cycle (mainly from oceanic solar input) of c63yrs, we are at a similar stage to the early 1960s which I remember well. It is
not hotter now. We also know why Maurice Strong started this CAGW thing. It is political, not scientific. "On page 982 from WD1AR5 final they don​t call it a plateau, but it is what it is." ​The ASK

results and the initialised predictions both suggest that those CMIP5 models that warm most rapidly over the period (1986​2005) to (2016​2035) may be inconsistent with the observations.​

As a member of the Climate Reality Leadership Corps, we demand decisive action on climate change, we have seen too much talk,

analysis and too little action. Is time for a government that governs with long term goals in mind, leaving politics apart and understand
the responsibility they have with the citizens of New Zealand and the world community.
I feel that we need to move MUCH more aggressively on this, the topic of our times and very existence. More action. REAL innovation

spend, not R&D tax credits for our largest corporations. Isuane of green bonds. Acting like this is the crisis that it is.




 
Thank god government is finally taking this seriously, because it's seriously scary.
Please withhold my name and contact details from publishing on the MfE website or in any summary of submission.
From my readings the assumption that climate warming is due entirely or mostly to carbon emissions is not sufficiently supported by

 the science. Yes, the conclusion that climate warming is due to human activity has been supported sufficiently to be accepted, but
 what human activity? I don't believe that the thinned ozone layer has been ruled out. The additional solar energy let into the
 atmosphere because of the thinned ozone layer appears to match quite closely the temperature increases. I am concerned that

 most people seem to treat 'climate change' as necessarily due to 'greenhouse gases' and indeed that most people conflate the two
 concepts. Weirdly, ozone is considered a greenhouse gas so the theory suggests we should get rid of the ozone layer. Ridiculous.
 Let's restore the ozone layer to historical quantity before imposing getting too carried away with reducing carbon. Charging people for

 carbon emission will be a den of corruption, the money going to unknown profiteers to little good end. There are other good reasons
 for reducing carbon and pollutant emissions but this can be achieved by promoting alternative energy industries. Taxing people who
 are largely trapped into the current circumstance is abusive. Provide alternatives.
The Bill's title should be changed to read: The Xero Emissions Bill because it must apply to all greenhouse gases not just carbon.

The utmost urgency must be applied to setting up the Climate Change Commission. The changes set in motion by decades of global
polluting cannot be stopped by a few political decisions, hoping the problem will go away. We will all be affected for generations to

come. The actions taken now can only mitigate these effects. However without serious action now, life on Earth will be far worse.
Show strength, vision and integrity in leading the way. Kia kaha.
Please don't take your time planning and discussing- every minute that happens, thats every more minute that a factory produces

harmful fossil fuels, and cars on roads. Please just take action now as all the evidence is there. Look at modern, eco-friendly counries
such as Finland, Iceland, Sweden, Spain. Thank you for all your guys' hard work <3 Just don't pay yourselves as if you are gods and
get 300,000 dollars a year and use that money for our world which may not be here for that much longer if we don't do something

now :)
I would like to see greater incentives for EVs. NZ has great existing infrastructure for EVs but very weak incentives - far lower than
many other countries despite our clear advantages in this area. We also risk being a dumping ground for stranded ICE vehicles. There

is significant pent up demand internationally for quality EVs and only limited production capacity (look at the Tesla Model 3 waiting list
& the Hyundai Kona EV is sold out in many markets). We may also see ICE vehicles being more aggressively marketed in NZ as they
lose market share to EVs internationally - this is an inevitable market response in countries without incentives or fuel efficiency

requirements. My household will be replacing one of our vehicles at the end of the year and I am actively shopping for a suitable EV,
however my options are either too expensive or unsuitable. I also consider the environmental benefits of PHEVs to be overstated, as

well as economics not stacking up considering the additional upfront cost and maintenance. The feebate system proposed by the
Productivity Commission would make the higher upfront cost of a suitable EV more palatable.
While the policy outcomes are very much needed, there is a question on strategic risk oversight. Climate change is recognised

internationally as a National Security threat by many western nations. In that vein, New Zealand should recognise climate change as a
National Security threat and afford it treatments and strategic oversight by the Cabinet National Security Committee and subordinate

officials' committee and watch group(s). As a matter of international representation regarding New Zealand's commitment to the
policy outcomes as proposed, the Bill should prohibit trade negotiations which would either dilute the purpose of this policy objective
or otherwise add to international climate emissions by the other party(s) to a trade agreement. Through this policy objective and

subsequent Bill/legislation, New Zealand must be seen to be a leader in climate change management. This is this generation's
nuclear free moment, and we need to grasp the potential as well as be honest as to the cost as openly and robustly as possible.
I would like to see this Government encourage the governments of other Countries with which NZ has trading relationships, to which
NZ provides any form of aid or with which NZ cooperates on other matters, to enact and implement a similar Zero Carbon Act.
Food and fibre producers in NZ are concerned at a fundamental level with Kaitiakitanga and Legacy. They will want to adopt and adapt
to this legislation. The Government needs to consider how they can best support farmers to make the required changes, without

pushing their costs of production up so much that their customers start buying from higher emitting competitors. There is no point in
putting a sector out of business that is globally an emissions efficient system. The goal should be to support greater levels of
emissions efficiencies in that system. I would also like to highlight the Government's need to prioritise training and capability for

people - we will need scientists and technology developers, but we might also need different primary sector skills or retraining
farmers if we end up with land use changes. Finally, I want to exhort the Government to consider this legislation alongside the full

gambit of environmental issues facing food and fibre producers and on which they have worked hard already. There is no gain if we
sacrifice water quality work or biodiversity in order to reduce emissions. Policy to reduce emissions should ensure it does not have

adverse environmental outcomes in other aspects. Equally, BIOSECURITY needs to be kept front of mind when adopting or
embracing technology for emissions reductions, especially from off-shore.
The Paris agreement is a shame on humans. It is unfortunately needed because we are unable to make ourselves do what is

necessary without others being made to do the same. We have all created this situation and must all respond to trying to mitigate
some of it. The government must react more urgently than it is doing at present regardless of what any previous government did to

make things more difficult now. At present Regional Councils are granting consents which are negating any efforts to mitigate climate
change. There should be a moratorium on all consents now. In the Edgecumbe Flood of 2017 I lost my family home of 30 years. The
Council has taken over my property to repair the breached stopbank and reposition a roadway but is negating any works it does by

granting consents which will produce more green house gas. Don't spend so much time on the bureaucracy that we make the
situation worse and are then less able to do something about it.
lets do this, I don't want to leave the planet in a worse state than when i arrived, it is the right thing to do for our society and the

ecosystem in general.




 
This is an urgent matter for the whole planet. We should be bold - make proper targets given the current scientific knowledge - and
work to the more pessimistic forecasts. Stop pandering to destructive industries (fossil fuel, animal farming). Make polices to help

those who will need to change how they work. Encourage the take-up of solar, wind power and electric cars; and encourage
innovation in these areas which can be used world-wide (business and education). Be a world leader on dealing with climate change.




 
Man-made climate change has simply been assumed to be true without a rigorous, impartial scientific debate. Claiming that the
'scientific community' has reached consensus is simply wrong, especially when skeptics are pushed off the media platform. The real

question is whether or not we should make any laws about carbon dioxide at all. Consequently, the great majority of these questions
are really quite irrelevant to the reality of the situation. Please just halt the zero carbon bill as it is, put it aside, and use the money to
provide warm, dry, securing housing for the most destitute New Zealanders and their families.
Scientists started warning us about the dangers of climate change over thirty years ago and yet we have done almost nothing to
address the problem in this country. We need to stop talking about it and start incentivizing radical change. Please get on with it.




 
Please get on with it!
Please get on with it!
The proposal about commission power is binary (decision power or no power at all), which will sadly influence the outcome of the

submissions you are gathering : It should have been a more open question. The commission should have at least a power of veto on
the government budget if it doesn't comply with the 2050 goal. I would like the government to explore the idea of an other chamber

of elected people with power of decision targeted on long term issues (climate change, but also other matters for generations to
come).
The background documents are clear and the consultation process is much appreciated. A technical note regarding monitoring the
impact of climate change: attribution of impacts is difficult. Normally thirty years of data is required to determine climate related trends.
However, waiting thirty years to attribute events or damages to climate change versus normal climate variation is impractical and

would not satisfy public and political demands for information on issues such as climate change loss and damage. An alternative
approach could be to allocate events and damages to be climate change related using a balance of evidence approach, then after

sufficient time has elapsed and data accumulated, the allocated events and damages can be attributed (on a robust statistical basis)
and compared with initial allocations. For example, if a heavy precipitation event is consistent with a pattern of climate change then it

might be allocated in part or full as being part of an anthropogenic climate change trend. Similarly the value of damages might also be
allocated to being climate change related based on the weight of evidence. The key to this approach is to update figures once more
time series data becomes available and to assess how accurate allocations appear with time (i.e. it is essential to practice allocations

and get feedback).




 
New Zealand has been inactive on carbon emissions for too long, with emissions up by 20% compared to 1990, while countries like
Germany, France, Denmark and others have been reducing carbon emissions. New Zealand needs to reduce emissions urgently and

rapidly. We owe this to future generations and our neighbours in the pacific that are threatened by rising sea levels and increasing
extreme weather events.




 
As I said before the science is not settled. For years now the climate change movement has silenced any scientists who try to speak

out against this ideologically driven crusade. The whole premise is flawed. You people have no concept of basic science. The sun
provides 99.99% of the planet's energy. As much as humans can influence the planet, our major impact is on species and land use.

So you should be much more worried about mass extinctions and deforestation if you really care about the environment. Stopping a
small country of 4.5 million people from functioning is going to do nothing when nations like the USA and China and India produce

thousands of times more pollution. Once again this whole exercise is to make the Green Party happy and to give Jacinda an anointed
path into a lifetime job at the United Nations. What a joke. History will judge you harshly for this.




 
Thinking about the wellbeing of my children and whatever grandchildren may follow, climate change is one of the issues I care about

most. Yet it's been hard for me to motivate myself to complete this submission. If I'm struggling to engage with something I claim to
be passionate about, how much harder will it be for other people to pay attention and make a submission? So, I would like to

acknowledge the difficulty that the government will have in bringing people on the journey through the tough decisions. Please make
sure you allocate sufficient ongoing budget to help tell the story about what we're doing as a nation, and why. A few years ago I wrote
some articles, published in the Bay of Plenty Times, about how we need to do whatever needs to be done to address climate

change. I've attached them as supporting documentation. They represent my view not as an expert, but as a layperson, a New
Zealander, a human, a citizen of the earth. I recall Bill English saying something like "I don't think most NZers wake up each morning
worrying about climate change." He's wrong. There are many, many people to whom this matters a great deal because we worry

about the future that our children and grandchildren will inherit. Thank you for making the first step with this bill.
Exclude name from the Ministry for the Environment website please.




 
This is urgent work. The Ao Maori perspective is fundamental to our nations response. We must act now for our children and the
planet and protect those who cannot protect themselves.




 
75% Vote by Parliament to set and change targets and policies In order to ensure stability of political purpose and cross-party
representation, the Carbon Bill should include the requirement that climate change targets and policies are set and changed only

when there is a 75% of all Members of Parliament endorsement vote. Immediate reductions in methane gas emissions All countries,
including New Zealand, need to reduce GHG emissions as soon as possible in order to reduce the risk of runaway methane

emissions from thawing tundra. Most methods of reducing GHG emissions take time, including planting saplings to absorb carbon
dioxide. In the meantime, seasonal adjusted levels of GHG in the atmosphere increase monotonically. Methane emissions by

ruminants in New Zealand contribute a major source of the nation’s carbon dioxide equivalents. A 10% reduction in methane
emissions could be implemented within weeks by Government decree to reduce herd numbers. Farmers around the world have
been paid not to grow crops. New Zealand can and should likewise pay its farmers to reduce their herds of ruminants and assist

transition to alternative food production. In the 1970s the New Zealand economy adapted to a three-fold followed by a two-fold
increase of petrol prices at the pump. This scale of adaptation far surpasses that of an immediate 10% reduction in herd numbers.

New Zealand has the economic resilience to absorb the costs of paying farmers to immediately reduce their herds by 10% which
would be followed by subsequent reductions in herd numbers as farmers transition to alternative food production. I recommend that

Government immediately decrees a 10% reduction in ruminant herd numbers in New Zealand. 100% renewable electricity. New
Zealand needs to phase out use of fossil fuel-based generation of electricity by 2050 and according to a confidence & supply
agreement between the Labour Party and the Green Party, the nation’s Climate Commission will be requested to plan the transition to

100% renewable electricity by as early as 2035. However, in its 2018 Draft Report, the Productivity Commission’s recommendations
R12.1 to R12.4 for the Electricity Authority on page 433 do not include the need and urgency for Government to invest in renewable

energy projects in its programme of works. The Draft Report states on page 321 that "if reducing emissions from electricity
generation significantly increases the costs of electricity, this could delay the electrification of other sectors where the reductions are

potentially larger." An Emissions Pricing Scheme can provide Government with revenue and this revenue can be used by Government
to invest in renewable energy projects to maintain stable electricity prices. A 2017 survey by Carl and Fedor which tracks current

global carbon revenues has established that Cap-and-trade systems (ETS) earmark 70% of revenues for “green” spending. The New
Zealand Government can and should follow suit by either investing directly in renewable energy projects or by subsidising smaller
scale renewable energy projects initiated by City Councils, community groups, or individuals. I recommend that Government invests in

renewable energy projects using revenue generated by an adopted Emissions Pricing Scheme in order to attain 100% renewable
electricity by 2050. Electrification of the New Zealand city-to-city railway network. The Productivity Commission’s 2018 Draft Report

addresses electrification of the North Island Main Trunk line and the advantages of doing so on page 310, but does not include a
recommendation to electrify New Zealand’s city-to-city railway network. The Draft Report assumes and endorses that market place

forces alone will result a major transition from fossil-fuelled vehicles to EVs by 2050. A major uptake of EVs is technically feasible, but
is not necessarily viable given the high private costs of purchasing EVs and replacement of their batteries, whereas an essential
electrification of New Zealand’s railway network is both technically feasible and viable provided Government undertakes the

commitment to do so. I recommend that Government electrify the city-to-city New Zealand railway network. Examination of the
continuation to provide power to the Tiwai Point aluminium smelter The Productivity Commission’s 2018 Draft Report states on page

294 that “Electric vehicles are one of New Zealand’s most promising mitigation opportunities.” A 100% fleet of electric vehicles in
New Zealand by 2050 would require substantial additional electricity generation. The Draft Report addresses ways of reducing

demand for electricity in a number of sectors in the economy and mentions on page 333 that the aluminium smelter plant at Tiwai
Point could be “incentivised” to help smooth demand peaks and reduce the need for on-call thermal generation. The Tiwai Point

aluminium smelter plant currently uses 570 MW of electricity which is about 15% of current peak hydro electricity output. This level of
continuous consumption of electricity begs the question of whether the Tiwai Point aluminium smelter plant’s continued use of
electricity should take priority over New Zealand’s need for additional electricity during the transition phase from fossil fuels to

renewable energy. A comprehensive study of peak demand and risk should include not only “incentivisation” to help smooth demand
peaks but also address the issue of whether the Tiwai Point smelter plant should continue to use such a large percentage of New

Zealand’s hydroelectricity output. I recommend that Government carries out a study of the impact of the Tiwai Point aluminium
smelter plant continuing its current consumption of electricity when additional electricity will be needed by electric vehicles and

electrification of a city-to-city New Zealand railway network. GDP is an inadequate indicator of wellbeing The two different economic
models developed by Vivid Economics (Vivid) and the New Zealand Institute of Economic Research (NZIER) to gain insights into the
economy-wide impacts of reaching different emissions reductions targets are both seriously flawed. This is because their projections

of progress are based on projections of GDP which is not an indicator of wellbeing. GDP conflates all forms of economic activity
regardless of positive or negative impacts on wellbeing. An example is the economic activity of rebuilding required after earthquakes

hit Christchurch. Few people would claim that citizens in Christchurch were better off after the destructive earthquake and during the
rebuild. GDP makes no adjustment for leisure time. The number of work hours can increase rather than decrease in order to retain a

standard of living. GDP counts only those goods and services that are recorded through official markets and leaves out home
production and black-market activity. GDP makes no adjustments for the distribution of goods and services. For example, a minority of

the population can enjoy higher standards of living as GDP per capita increases while the majority struggle more and more to make
ends meet. GDP does not measure externalities of economic activity. An example is the deterioration of our waterways in recent years
due to pollution generated by the agricultural sector. Nobel prize-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz noted at a World Economic Forum

in Davos, Switzerland in 2016 that "GDP is a poor way of assessing the health of our economies and we urgently need to find a new
measure." There are alternative indicators of welfare. For example, the Index of Sustainable Economic Welfare accounts for both

pollution costs and the distribution of income and the Genuine Progress Indicator adjusts for factors such as income distribution,
adds factors such as the value of household and volunteer work, and subtracts factors such as the costs of crime and pollution. I

recommend that Government replaces GDP as a measure of wellbeing with OECD endorsed indicators of wellbeing. Assumption that
New Zealand should strive for economic growth. The Ministry for the Environment (MFE) FINAL- Zero Carbon Bill - Discussion
Document and the Productivity Commission’s 2018 Draft Report both assume that New Zealand is able to and should strive for

continued economic growth during the transition from fossil fuels to renewables. A 2% increase in economic activity each year would
result in a doubling of economic activity in 35 years’ time. It is highly questionable whether this target should be attempted given the

need to reduce greenhouse gases rather than increase them. Some proponents claim that GDP and energy can be decoupled, but
there are physical and thermodynamic limits to the extent that decoupling can take place. A transition from fossil fuels to renewable

energy will, of course, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, but a major problem is that such a transition will require use of fossil fuels
to set up new infrastructure, plant, machinery, vehicles etc. (embodied energy) at the very same time as the need to reduce

greenhouse gas emissions. In order to satisfy both requirements, use of fossil fuels will therefore need to be diverted from that of
consumption to that of investment. Expectations that business as usual can and will continue during a transition from fossil fuels to
renewable energy and that economic growth can and should continue at a time when we need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions

are unrealistic. Hybrid Emissions Pricing Scheme The Productivity Commission’s 2018 Draft Report makes the following
Recommendation R4.1 on page 416: “The Government should reform the NZ Emissions Trading Scheme rather than replace it with a

carbon tax. The reforms should provide a good balance between control over unit supply (i.e., an effective emissions cap) and
protection against excessive volatility in the price of emission units. The reforms should also provide the institutional and regulatory

underpinnings for a credible and efficient market in emission units, as well as transparency and forward guidance to incentivise long-
term investments in lower emissions.” There are clear cut and distinctive advantages and disadvantages of a pure Carbon Tax versus
a pure Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) which are addressed in the preamble and findings that precede R4.1. Given the combination

of the preamble and findings followed by the wording of R4.1, the intent of R4.1 seems to seek the advantages of both a Carbon Tax
and an ETS. Such a scheme would be a hybrid scheme as described in the public literature and recommended by a number of

sources. The devil of implementation of a hybrid scheme lies within the details. For example, a hybrid scheme can be an ETS which
not only caps a limit on emissions, but also sets a minimum price cap which effectively results in a minimum carbon tax. I recommend

that New Zealand adopts a Hybrid Emissions Pricing Scheme with a cap on emissions and a minimum cap on carbon pricing with full
Government control over the auction process.
If the government is serious about reducing our CO2 emissions, they'll begin by dropping the national speed limit, perhaps to 80 (the
USA dropped to 90 during the oil-embargo). Energy required to maintain a velocity is quadratic with speed, so lower speeds should

conserve significant fuel and allow for smaller and lighter commute vehicles to operate safely. Cargo should be sent via rail or cargo
ship and not over expensive roadways (road damage is exponential with the weight of the vehicle - and we used to have a law about

this very thing.) Carpooling should be encouraged - and since we know where and when everyone goes (thanks to their cellular
phone automatic registration messages), the government could encourage those who travel in parallel to join together for their
commute. Working from home should also be encouraged. Diesel Road User Charges should be added at the fuel pump, so those

inefficient vehicles actually pay their fair share relative to those diesel vehicles that are more economical - leaving it as it is adds an
unnecessary overhead (purchasing the RUC) and gives heavy vehicles that damage the roads no incentive to improve their efficiency.

I have many such ideas, and I'm not seeing much of these ideas discussed anywhere. But perhaps it's because I don't watch TV and
the broadcast radio sucks.
I am really excited that this bill is being mooted - what can ordinary citizens do to help?
As a member of Oxfam NZ and a grandmother of four small granddaughters I think it is very important that future generations grow up
knowing we cared about limiting emissions to NetZero by 2050, and cared about our Pacific and global neighbours.
It is time again for NZ to show global leadership. A bold domestic emissions reduction agenda should be matched by equally
ambitious international climate change initiatives.
I am attempting to launch a vehicle retrofitting project in Southland essentially creating a new industry and finding the process slow

and difficult due to the current bureaucratic process of government, so the need for a government lead "priority declaration" is seen
for such an industry to be able to move forward quickly, as there is urgency to begin the climate adaptation process, to take the

predicted 25 years to install a new fleet of EV's is a way too long timeframe, retrofitting the existing fleet would speed the process, be
a huge financial and environmental saving and provide employment at the same time, retrofitting may in fact become the best option

to replace our current ICE fleet due to global economic and trade circumstances, to not cut through the bureaucratic process could
otherwise be our downfall, a ministry official recently asked me how much would this retrofitting cost/ My response is how much will it
cost not to do so, both in an environmental and monetary sense. I wish to speak further at select committee stage about retrofitting

the New Zealand vehicle fleet.
This is very promising work, well done so far!
I do strongly support this initiative
I am very concerned that anything put in legislation will be too compromised to be effective. Yes it is important to have an all party
agreement, but not at the expense of making a difference.
We need to factor in the impact of air travel on national and international emissions. This will impact on tourism.
I consider that the commission needs to have a term other than 3 years to take it out of the term of government. My main fear is that
future governments can water down the regulations and delay the targets because of pressure from their supporters.
Only naive and scientifically destitute dilletantes believe in climate change. A good start is to work out the difference between
weather and climate.Weather is an incredibly complex and chaotic system controlled by the sun and sunspot activity,the tilt of the

earth's axis, the orbit around the sun and the earth's magnetic field to name but a few. Carbon is the building block of ALL life on
earth.CO2 levels have been triple what they are now at various times in history.Carbon greens the planet.There is NO scientific

evidence supporting climate change.Believers have been totally conned by Gore showing videos of melting icebergs.The Antarctic
ice sheet is increasing.The evidence is overwhelming and incontrovertible but evident only to those with the common sense and

acumen to drill down and discover it. Climate change? Prove it using evidence based scientific data,not videos of melting icebergs.
I have worked as an agronomist on farms for nearly 30 years. Over his time I have seen a lot of my clients soils improving over time

and building organic matter. Those who use a lot of artificial nitrogen fertiliser or cultivation lose organic matter. Although livestock
may emit a lot of methane and nitrous oxide which are greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, if the soil is acting as a carbon sink,

then this needs to be considered. I have also observed with forestry conversions to pasture, that initially there is very little topsoil the
first year or two, but over time there is a definite topsoil layer being built which is permanent C being held in the soil once it turns
certain to humic compounds. Forestry is not the be all and end all, soils which have grown a crop of trees have less soil carbon than

what sheep and beef farms will have sequestered over the same time. Trees can act as a carbon sink, but once harvested, the
carbon is gone. Soil carbon sequestration is one long term answer to increased CO2 levels and needs to be considered in the big

picture if there is going to be honest science in this whole discussion. Just because Simon Upton excluded soil carbon in the 1990
Kyoto Accord, does not mean it should be excluded in future accords or developments. Scientific knowledge is an ever improving,

more precise pool of knowledge, and needs to be free from political agendas/interference.



 
I worry about our local body politicians who are incapable of understanding the issues and don't even believe it is happening. They
think throwing rocks at the sea will fix it! We need the government to take control as this bill proposes.
Electric cars - a significant increase in electric cars would have considerable benefits to NZ 1. Reduced emissions from combustion
 cars 2. Reduced balance of payments from reduced oil imports 3. Utilise our high level of renewable energy. Currently electric cars are

 considerably more expensive than combustion cars which is reducing uptake. To increase the numbers of electric cars you should
 remove GST from electric cars for 5 years and (if required) increase duty on diesel cars to fund it. Diesel cars are being phased out in
 Europe as they produce considerable emissions. Also consider funding a buy back scheme for cars which use more than 10 litres

 per 100kms. and are more than 10 year old to tak old and inefficient cars off the road.
Please do not plant more Pinus Radiata!! we have far to many already. We need trees that make quality timber not sap wood that is

dependent of chemicals for durability. Farms can have up to one third of the area planted in trees and grow more grass. We need a
much more integrated landscape according to the capabilities of the land
Thank you for the opportunity to have some input. I feel strongly about global warming and that NZ can only benefit from taking a lead

globally in emission reduction. Short term costs will give long term advantage in to the future. I am a Nurse and am dismayed at the
short term view , and token gestures that hospitals take towards waste reduction. An example of this immoral approach to global

resources : single use stainless steel scissors and forceps which are imported from third world ? India, used once, then discarded. In
the past hospitals have had larger sterilisation services and good quality scissors etc have been autoclaved and reused. The
economics of this situation is immoral and happens in many areas of business- and points to reasons why we are in our current

environmental predicament
Thank you all for your very hard work at getting this submission and detailed discussion document prepared. It is a very positive move
in the right direction and gives me hope for the future. I trust you will find overwhelming support from parliament, NZ and the world for
doing this.




 
Yes, the more information we have the better we can respond to risks/impacts and track how well we are doing.
promoting plant based diets, planting more trees especially in urban areas




 
We need to seriously consider that the vast majority of short lived gasses are coming from NZ agriculture. The consultation held on

the 4th July in Wellington referenced 'the evolution of technology' a lot and seemed to rely on this as our saviour. Sure, there will be
cleaner alternatives that can replace the comforts embedded into our current lifestyles - such as the electric car. This will be huge for
reducing the amount of carbon emission if we are to look at the ecological running cost of cars. It does not however take into

consideration the embodied emissions of a cars production, and how their accessibility (of having extremely low running costs) will
impact the way we use vehicles. It is likely that due to their availability, the amount of cars on the road will increase, along with their

use. So we've got to consider the surrounding infrastructure around alternative technologies and how they may contribute further
unsustainable habits.




 
Thank you for putting together a well considered climate change consultation that will be beneficial for the current and future

generation of New Zealanders. I 100% support this initiative and having a Climate Change Commission empowered to ensure these
bod decisions are made reality.
JUST DO IT. Honestly. Take a stand. Be radical. Our country and people will benefit so much more in the long term.



 
On March 2017 I became a grandmother for the first time. My granddaughter was 8 weeks premature. Doctors do not know why my
daughter in law didn't carry to term. My granddaughter is a survivor and at 16 months she is developing in the prem spectrum. A little

behind, but doing fine. Now, her family is concerned about the survival of New Zealand. Finally, with everything we know as fact about
the warming of the planet and our oceans, we have a government that is working towards solutions for my future and my

grandaughter's future. Last February, we had 2 hurricanes (I prefer to call tropical cyclones hurricanes) rip though our Tasman Bay
destroying 2 iconic, waterfront buildings. The REASON these hurricanes went South instead of their typical Northerly direction is

beacuse the Tasman Sea was 6 degrees warmer than "normal'. Now, Nelson/Tasman residents need to learn about hurricane
protection/survival. The new norm. Including adaptation is essential. Having a Climate Change Commission that is part of government
forever...a new government can't come in and undo it is also essential.
We are a small country with a history of innovation which should make us ideally placed to enact real, substantial and revolutionary
change. We must resist the calls of those who for economic or social reasons want to retain the status quo. We cannot continue to

use resources and create waste (be it landfill or gas emissions) in the way we are doing at the moment. Investment in a 'greener'
economy will pay dividends in the the future not just in terms of climate change but also economical, social and lifestyle benefits that

need to be for all in Aotearoa.
Humans have had a very narrow window to do something about climate change. Perhaps 50 years, of which 30 have already passed -
and we have literally lost considerable ground already. For the sake of future generations to enjoy this beautiful planet, DON'T MESS IT

UP.
Thank you for consulting on this important matter.
Supplementary information attached.
The Government should not buy credits from any source. In the past the National government bought credits which were not

genuine. This should never happen again.
There is far too little focus on the seriousness of the problem and the difficulties in making real progress. The expertise seems too
weak. Expertise on how to keep an economy functioning with transformative policies is essential. Clear plans must be prepared

otherwise targets become pipe dreams. The most likely outcome, without clearly focusing on the difficulties, is that it will become too
hard and reactions against climate change as in the US and Australia become more likely.
Can we get this enacted immediately please; we're guilty of squandering a precious decade already!
All sectors of the NZ socio-Economic paradigm need to be made aware of the near term 6th Mass Extinction on this planet. That
includes, Government (All departments), Business (All), Public Organisations and the population at large.
This actually needs to be expanded into reporting on potential stranded assets and environmental liabilities in standard financial
reporting for businesses - particularly listed businesses. There are movements overseas to encourage businesses to report on

these issues, so encouragement would help move towards greater standardisation and acceptance, moving them towards GAAP.
Reporting is like sunshine...
Complete reduction of carbon must be done earlier than 2050. Action must be taken now. Questions over the ETS and forestry

sector.
Please only post my first name and notes. Please do not include my phone, email, address, or surname on your website.




 
sharing information sounds good?
Multiple schemes and incentives should be introduced to assist in meeting targets including: improving building code towards higher
energy performance, introduction of compulsory energy rating system. Incentives for EV's and PV should be looked at. With coal

being the main and growing source of global fossil CO2, alternatives to coal should be a high priority with planned the transition away
from coal mining and coal export. NZ should work with international partners on transition to low carbon transport for tourism and
trade.
My key concern with the bill is the potential to lock in very high costs of ambitious leadership in climate change mitigation when the

effectiveness of our leadership is uncertain and the global benefits of more ambitious mitigation targets, should our leadership be
effective, is also uncertain. This is not to say we shouldn't do something, and some aspects of the bill, such as the climate change

commission and a strong emphasis on adaptation have strong merit. I would just like to see some flexibility to manage our future
commitments as new information comes to light.
The name of the Zero Carbon Bill/Act should be reconsidered. Given that it includes both adaptation and mitigation its name should

reflect both these areas. Possibilities are: The Climate response act; the Climate Change Act.
There needs to be transparency in how we support the Islands in the Pacific and there needs to be transparency in general. This bill

must include a requirement to produce annual reports about New Zealand’s international climate change.
I fully support this initiative. It is closely based on the UK model which is proving successful. It is a pity this legislation wasn't
implemented much earlier in NZ.
Many societal ills such as obesity and the health consequences of that are created as a consequence of consuming ultra-processed
foods. Going to zero-carbon will inevitably remove ultra-processing of food and thereby contribute to fixing the environment. Many

aspects of becoming carbon-neutral will correct other problems.



 
It is excellent and useful to have this discussion. Now, we need to move fast to allow for a viable mitigation pathway, to avoid the most
severe of climate change consequences, to gain from the benefits of our transition to a carbon neutral world and to position New

Zealand as a leader, role model and good citizen of the world.




 
if this was done in a constructive and streamlined way that didnt impose unwarranted reporting requirements on organisations and

companies that in the end, didnt really add positively or constructively to the overall picture and outcomes.
Financial incentives (eg tax breaks) required to encourage industry and commerce to move towards renewable options. Legislate to

ensure non-renewable items (eg plastic bags are have a financial disincentive)
Do not f    this up guys! Take a leaf out of Danmark's book - they are a relative success story here. It's not like you have to reinvent
the wheel, just use what is already working.




 
The introduction of this bill is a great step and very required - although decades too late. Government needs to keep continual focus
on emission reduction and be prepared for NZ to take necessary measures to lead in the battle against Carbon. Much education is

needed - this is certainly part of the role for the Climate Commission. Threats to the successful meeting of the budget need to be
identified and handled. Similarly win-win scenarios abound in this space e.g. tourism, public health, efficiency and cost reduction, new

technology and innovation, green jobs ...... and much can be made of each step we make on our way to Net Zero. Consideration
needs to be given to changing market structures where current arrangements have been seen to work against the need for change.
Examples include electricity where incumbents generators are happy to delay the build of renewable generation - for fear of lowering

market prices and disturbing windfall profits. If we are to see a widespread electrification of transport and industry then it is likely that
new wind and geothermal generation will be needed post haste. Similarly infrastructure provision such as EV Charging requires a role

for the state either significant funding or direct action (e.g. California) - here benefits are spread widely and do not make a commercial
profit easily achieved.
This will facilitate information sharing between groups with similar issues. Best practice models can be shared to support
organisations on their journey to zero carbon.
Yes, this would be a useful integrated & collaborative approach
The climate has been changing since the last ice age, and at times much more rapidly than at present. The commission needs to
take a balanced and informed view of the issues involved as the financial and living standard implications of changes in our climate.

Energy will be an important element in allowing us to cope with climate change, and the loss of the benefits of farming and energy
production to New Zealanders has to be carefully weighed against the greenhouse gas emission effects, and how these fit into the

global emissions pool. Mans effect on the climate is a global issue and should be resolved primarily at global forums.

For the first time in a long time, I'm hopeful for my children's future. We have a unique opportunity as a small island nation to be real

leaders here - I hope we take it boldly and change the world in all of our favour.




 
I can remember my father complaining about climate change many years ago in the forties. It is not a new phenomenon and is at
least partly a natural occurrence. Are we not supposed to be coming out of a minor ice age?
I am concerned about if we uptake electric vehicles - what will happen to the cars we already have - how will we dispose of them? I

would hope the bill outlines how we will transition to an 100% renewable transport model effectively. Also regarding the recycling
crisis arising from China - I hope this bill will set out actions for investing in onshore industries to manage our own waste. To be more

sustainable, we have to invest in sustainable initiatives. Kaitiakitanga is very important to me as a born and bred kiwi. These values
should play a large part in our actions for net carbon zero by 2050. There is no second chance. We have to act NOW. I agree with the

points raised below the following on page 41 "For the Climate Change Commission to be successful and become a trusted and
stable part of New Zealand’s government institutions, it would need." Finally, Is there going to be legislation that ensures foreign

corporations comply by these plans if they do business in NZ? E.g. film industry, international business events, foreign exporters to
NZ, airlines etc.?




 
Actual climate change effects are not entirely clear. The zero carbon bill should just focus on it's core role of reducing Co2 emissions.
We are a small country that has capacity to embrace change quickly (because of our size), this needs to be about the people. Every

day NZers need to feel a part of this, they need to be informed and empowered to contribute the change in their own lives (this
means leadership, direction, clear guidelines that filter through to local govt), while seeing bigger picture change supported at a

national level. If this sits at the top, powered by 'experts' it will not have the same impact as a 'by the people for the people' approach.
There is so much willingness, knowledge, 'expertise' and capacity within the social networks of NZ to create significant and
meaningful change, its vital the Govt does not ignore this.
Insufficient scientific unbiased research has been carried out on this topic.Government is heavily swayed by ignorant uneducated and
unverified viewpoints.
this will not help to stop climate change, so don't waste peoples money.
Mandated reporting requirements will serve to improve transparency and will assist organisations and Government in more effective

risk management.
Healthy soil can absorb methane via Methantrophs. More works needs to be done here but be very careful on taxing methane from
ruminants. Science will tell us that ruminants are vital to rebuilding topsoil/OM on cropping farms, and storing high levels of carbon on

pasture land. Dung Beetles are crucial for reducing N2O and maybe even methane. Bare soil ie winter cropping is very bad, diverse
forages and better grazing practises without N fertilser is the future. We Extracting fossil fuels are the main problem, so we should be
promoting natural products like wool, hemp etc. We need to use Regenarative farming priniclples that not only improve the

environment, but demand a greater premium of product prices is the future. Synthetic proteins cannot claim that they can improve
our natural resources. Farming is not the problem, it is how we are farming. Photo's below demonstrate some of our different forages

for stock, and harvesting wheat while having N fixing clover underneath and keeps a live plant growing that protects the soil and
requires no N fertilser.
Take the computer model out of so called climate change and refer to old records, such as old diaries of our predeceases on what
the weather patterns were then.
I support the creation of an independent climate change commission with strong powers to ensure New Zealand reaches net zero
emissions by 2050.

There is little sense in penalising this country’s economic and social future by over zealous adoptions of flawed science . By all
means penalise fossil fuel usage but in areas of this science where there is considerable doubt tread very carefully . Much more

accurate information will be gleaned on our travel to 2050 and it is policy and action on the real , not the perceived that is required.
It is very important that the ZCB and the final Act have broad support across all sectors of society and politics. This should not be a
political football. We should also consider our Pacific island links and relationships.The ZCB could be enacted with support being

offered to vulnerable, less well resourced Pacific nations.
Any thing YOU do will not effect climate change.I do not want my name used in any summary.
Newer technology like solar power and electric vehicles need to be better supported either through legislation e.g. all new

houses/commercial buildings need to include solar panels, or subsidy programme so that they are available to a wider cross section
of New Zealanders. The bigger the market for these technologies the more the price will drop and make them a much more viable
option and more businesses will get into providing these types of technologies.
At the moment their is big pressure on farming. Why is there no pressure on transport particularly air traffic as their emissions go
straight into circulation.
Why should we become a world leader in this area when we are so small and most of the world's population don't even know where

we are?
Waste of money. No benefit to nz. Scam. You are ruining this country.
Follow the tax and understand the overarching strategy. “A globalist aspiration to reduce global population.” This strategy will achieve
its goal and those who implement and support this venture through the tax will unfortunately be the first to realise their mistake.
There is a need to minimise the government's ability to ignore or deviate from the Climate Commission advice. The government must
justify any deviations within a certain time-frame. The Commission's advice needs to have teeth.

The alleged detrimental effect of CO2 has been misunderstood. Over the past 30 years, an area the size of a continent has greened

(just think of the additional oxygen that has been generated from photosynthesis). No account is taken of that for farmers in NZ, who
grow grass to feed their stock. It is a closed cycle as stock emissions are offset by sequestered CO2.
To me it seems that to date the accounting system, including the ETS, has been broken. Emissions in a biological cycle should not

be included. Forestry is not the fix all that government seems to think, it has many negative effects as well. If the accounting is done
properly I suspect that NZ's emissions in the world scheme of things are miniscule. There is alot of other pollution here that should

be dealt to, look at all the garbage that stores like The Warehouse, and the other "cheap crap" stores which are popping up
everywhere are bringing into the country all of which will ultimately end up in the landfill. Why don't you do something about that? And

reducing packaging - the gains that we make by bringing our re-usable bags to the supermarket are all lost by the likes of Pams
putting half a dozen tomatoes in a plastic container. And when you buy something the size of a matchbox on line, and it comes in a
whole lot of packaging? Why don't you do something about that? I think we will be buried in our own rubbish long before we run out of

oxygen or get frazzled by the sun.
Please stop fluffing about and get on with it. The time is over for discussion, action is needed now. Don't let profit get in the way of

the moral, humane actions that need to happen. Now
Dear Minister, I support the passing of legally binding climate law and maintain that Climate Change is a global problem – it cannot be
tackled by countries in isolation. The law must be fair, ambitious and consistent with the climate science and international frameworks

by including all gases and all sectors. The legislation should establish the goal of limiting warming to 1.5 degrees. We should not
settle for 2 degrees warming, that would lock in devastating impacts on Pacific Island states and cause significant extinctions. That is

not acceptable. To give us the best possibility of achieving no more than 1.5 degrees warming by the end of the century, there must
be rapid cuts in all greenhouse gases beginning now. I support a net-zero target of 2040 with the majority of cuts occurring over the

next decade. I support all greenhouse gases being included in the law, consistent with international climate frameworks. The
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change makes it clear that methane reduction is critical to success in tackling climate change. It
is politically and scientifically untenable for New Zealand’s climate law to exclude any gases from our biggest emitting sector - the

agricultural sector. I support the establishment of a Climate Commission, whose role should be to devise binding budgets. The
Climate Commission should have statutory teeth, otherwise, it is merely an advisory group that governments could ignore. Climate

budgets should be legally binding and set a bare-minimum ambition, which must be achieved or bettered by government within the
prescribed timeframes. Finally, while budgets should be binding, policy recommendations from the Commission should be just that -

recommendations. I strongly support the ‘firewall’ principle – that New Zealand’s targets must be achieved by actual cuts in our own
emissions, and not through the purchase of overseas carbon credits or an over-reliance on forests as carbon sinks. Regarding our
international commitments, the Bill must include a requirement that governments produce annual reports about New Zealand’s

international climate change contributions. As a Pacific nation, we must ensure that the Pacific countries get the support they need to
adapt to the devastating effects of climate change and their changing environment – a problem they contributed very little to. Access

to climate finance is a matter of justice: those who have contributed least to the causes of the problem are typically the most
vulnerable to its impacts and have the least resources to respond. New Zealand must demonstrate global leadership and match its

bold vision for lower carbon emissions at home by having an equally ambitious climate change strategy abroad. While consensus
across political parties is preferred, any cross-party agreement should not be achieved at the cost of strong climate law. Climate

change is the greatest challenge facing humanity. It would be wrong to have broad agreement on weak law, when what is urgently
needed to address the problem is strong law. The world needs pathways to transformational change if we are to avoid catastrophic
warming. This is the scale of the challenge. The science is clear: the only way we can succeed is with big ambition. New Zealand
must be bold and pass strong law for the sake of our precious earth and future generations. Nga Mihi Artur Francisco
Important for NZ to cease oil and coal extraction and exploration and to invest in alternatives.
I am a General Practitioner and support Ora Taiao’s position. I am personally prepared to forgo future gains in income and quality of

life, to pay more income tax and have my cost of living higher and ease of living reduced if it means my children will not be faced with
the crisis of climate change. I would much prefer strong immediate action with impacts on current GDP than reactive responses once

the crisis is here. In saying that, I am very concerned about the impacts of change on our most vulnerable citizens. I do not want to
see another 1984, nor GFC scale tidal wave of unemployment. The most vulnerable should be protected and supported. The Treaty

must be respected. I do not support simple consultation of Māori. They are the original and ongoing kaitiaki of NZ/Aotearoa and
should have a significant and, ideally, leading role within the Commission. Thank you for your consideration.
The Zero Carbon Bill does not consider, recognise or encourage any carbon capture methods other than growing trees. This is very
short-sighted and limiting what is possible to achieve. If we give carbon/greenhouse gases a sufficiently high price then CCS

solutions become viable. No consideration is given to influencing consumption behaviour (other than carbon pricing) when
alternatives exist. Why do we fail to learn from watching what works or fails in other countries?, Successful consumption levers include
e.g. tax the use of cars with engines >2 litres as they do in northern Europe and that changes behaviour and reduces consumption

dramatically. Encourage electric car uptake by using tax incentives (such as no GST) or rebates and subsidising electricity (works in
California and Norway). New Zealand has very expensive electricity at the domestic consumer level and something needs to done to

bring this into line with other OECD countries, i.e. bring it down so we can afford to use electricity to replace wood/biomass, coal, oil
and gas where possible. Also our electricity infrastructure will be strained if the proposed uptake of electricity conversions is even

partially achieved - where will the money for the required upgrades come from?



 
No
Now that the Leader of the Opposition has said his Party is willing to work with all Parties the Government needs to find a way to
incorporate his offer in to their planning. Climate Change is not a party political issue.
Focus on the goal not on the distractions of coping with the outcomes of the problem
Electrified rail transport is the cheapest and easiest way to substantially reduce carbon emissions but it is still expensive.
Honestly - just get on with it!
It is a separate area completely. Has nothing to do with the words 'zero carbon'
Mandated reporting requirements will serve to improve transparency and will assist organisations and Government in more effective
risk management.




 
I consider climate change the most important threat to humanity, and I don't think the position of any of the parties in Parliament
reflects this. We need more scientists working on the probable effects, and how to deal with them - and we need to listen to them.
Provisions need to be set in stone against the risk of any future National/Act government coming to power.
Thank you for consulting on this important issue. I am committed to reducing our farming GHG emissions and support the purposes

of the Zero Carbon Bill
mitigations will result in land use changes, this needs wide discussion looking at economic, social and regional impacts. We may

need to intensify agriculture in some areas while going to forestry in others.
It is quickly becoming apparent that proposed legislation on New Zealand's carbon emissions is likely leading towards unfair and
inequitable treatment of ruminant biological emissions. It is clear on scientific basis that ruminant carbon emissions occur in a closed

carbon cycle and thus are neutral in their contribution to atmospheric carbon. In order to avoid any unfairness or inequities in
government legislation such emissions must either be excluded or have their entire carbon cycle recognised. Doing so will ensure

fairness and equity and will also prevent important export industries that rely on ruminant animals from being disadvantaged in world
markets.
Get on with it, and put up some real strawman questions that we can practically comment on. Where are the questions re agricultural
emissions? What are the implications for the economy on an all gases scenario? Would it entail a radical move from pastoral

agriculture? Is it better for NZ to feed the world on its relatively low carbon agricultural model, or should we reduce our production and
emissions to the level that we can manage on a consumption basis? (Refer to the consumption model for carbon emissions that MfE

reports on and is referenced in the Thinkstep anaylsis https://www.thinkstep.com/content/carbon-footprint-new-zealands-built-
environment-hotspot-or-not , ie 19% from nutrition, 20% from built environment and 44% from transport, which is radically different

from how we report to the IPCC). Secondly, please don't undervalue the change that can be undertaken by individuals and
communities, particularly in relation to energy emissions. Include energy on a consumption basis (as above, 20%) and give relative
emphasis to buildings, which according to the IPCC has the biggest potential for reducing carbon emissions, largely because they are

so inefficient compared with transport and industry. (Refer https://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-
report/ar5/wg3/ipcc_wg3_ar5_chapter9.pdf : In summary, buildings represent a critical piece of a low-carbon future and a global

challenge for integration with sustainable development (robust evidence, high agreement). Buildings embody the biggest unmet
need for basic energy services, especially in developing countries, while much existing energy use in buildings in developed

countries is very wasteful and inefficient. Existing and future buildings will determine a large proportion of global energy demand.
Third, take into account behaviour change as well as improvement in energy efficiency when designing those interventions. The way
we use our buildings, cars, and especially our attitudes towards overseas travel, is at least as important as making those

modes/infrastructure more efficient to operate. Otherwise we risk taking those savings back in increased consumption.
The environment and climate needs to be key in this bill and society as it underpins everything we do and live. Behaviour needs to
change to be more environmentally friendly and legislation is key as some people will not change if they do not have to.
I'd like to make a submission on agricultural emissions, particularly the methane & CO2 emissions from bovines. 1. Grass & other

animal feed is created from atmospheric CO2, H2O & soil minerals. 2. Grazing animals are created wholly from grass or other feed
crops, H2O & O2 3. Humans & other omnivores are created from a mixture of points 1 & 2 above 4. Methane created by animals

breaks down into CO2 after 9-12 years 5. This is all part of the Carbon Cycle 6. When viewed over a 12 year timeframe, agricultural
emissions must be Carbon neutral; aside from any fossil fuels consumed in transport & production. 7. While we should be reducing

our consumption of fossil fuels, it is a mistake to punish agriculture for supposed emissions. 8. The greatest contributors to
anthropogenic climate change are the release of trapped Carbon via fossil fuel use & deforestation of areas which would otherwise
absorb it. 9. Concentrating efforts on improving point 8 above is our best chance of making a difference.
Climate change is a natural ongoing event, and is not caused by carbon. The government can help by staying out of something it

knows nothing about. Why on earth would government want to minimize production of one of the most essential compounds like
CO2. This is what supports plant growth and our existence, and the main reason we are thriving on this planet..
Need to ensure that any commercial plantation forests planted do not create other negative environmental impacts when cut down,
such as soil erosion and damage due to slash. Slash needs to be removed from forestry blocks and should be used for providing

heat and/or power systems as in other countries.
It is no longer business as usual.

I encourage Green MP’s to continue their work in all areas of conservation so that we all can look ahead to a healthy and happy

future.
Having good measurement tools and models is important so that we have accurate data to respond to and have confidence in our

plan. Thank you for allowing me to submit my thoughts.
Although a net zero target by 2050 is ambitious, it is likely to be insufficient to avoid even 2 degrees warming (even assuming all the
world's major emitters do the same). Recent research has shown that global emissions must peak by no later than 2030 to have a

reasonable chance of staying below 2 degrees (https://eciu.net/assets/peak-emissions/), and even this assumes negative
emissions will occur on a large scale later this century. Given this reality of the situation, it is worth considering an even more

ambitious target: net zero by 2040.
Please be ambitious. We are running out of time. This is about intergenerational justice - we can not ignore future generations. Let's

fix this mess we've created and not kick the can to future generations.
No
Include research on low tech / appropriate tech solutions thereby providing for local community resilience and reduced
environmental impact of solutions (high tech has more unforseen consequences.) Consider military preparedness for increased

resource-based conflicts especially in Pacific. Increase diplomatic work and joint planning with other nations to reduce likelihood of
resource-based conflicts particularly where we could be drawn in through traditional alliances. Consider how to build internal

economy so country can better weather downturns in export and especially tourist sectors.
There is very little discussion here of how emitters will be held accountable if they fail to reach targets. I would expect that the Zero
Carbon Bill will include clear legislation regarding this, and that penalties will be enforced. Without clear penalties then big emitters will

simply go on with business as usual.



 
On a slightly related matter, in early July 2018, I submitted a proposal to the Hutt City Council for an improved method of rubbish

disposal. This could hugely reduce the amount of waste plastic and paper in the environment, while easing the load on landfills,
improving the quality of material sent to recycling and providing useful "boiler fuel". This would involve no major changes to the

existing arrangements, but would add a new option. The new option ("Project Orange") would nominally involve using pre-paid,
orange-coloured plastic bags for combustible, non-halogenated solid waste materials. Households and businesses would voluntarily

put all odds and sods of waste plastic (non-halogenated), paper, cardboard, small wood scraps etc into this bag, which would be
collected by the council in the normal collection. But instead of going to landfill or recycling, it would be used for thermal power
generation, industrial steam generation, heating of large buildings or simply burned off to dispose of it. By being burned usefully, this

could hugely decrease the escape of plastics into the sea, heavily reduce the load on landfills, and allow a small reduction in
consumption of coal, natural gas and/or biomass. (The last part would be good for decreasing carbon dioxide emissions by

decreasing the mining and use of fossil fuels).
While it is important that we act now, it is also very important that we look after the viability of the nation for future generations. Many

of the conversations that have been had have come from the heart where emotion can take control with the talk being about the
need for large quick change. Many do not appreciate the implications that this will bring to many businesses and communities. We

must go through this process using our heads so that we have a carefully planned approach, giving time for adjustment and remain
with sustainable communities into the future. It must be remembered that the overall goal here is for reduced total global emissions.

We are one of the most efficient producers of agriculture product in the world. Any drastic actions which reduced our abilities to
provide this food to the world would likely result in extra production being picked up by a less efficient producing nation and therefore
negatively impact on total global emissions. While agriculture must play it part, science has indicated that we do not need to get to

zero short lived gas emissions to stabilise global temperatures, therefore don't over burden our economy.
New Zealand used to be a world leader in environmental management. We have the opportunity to do this again with an ambitious

climate change policy. NZ has the enviable position of already having a large portion of our electricity from renewable sources, making
the transition to Net Zero an easier reality than many other countries. Yes, we have high emissions from agriculture, but this provides

a unique opportunity to develop emission reduction technology and expertise that we can export around the world. Moreover, there
is clear evidence that industrial scale agriculture has adversely impacted our natural environment and tarnished our clean, green
image. Net Zero will see marginal land returned to forest, a much more sustainable alternative. Being an island nation at the mercy of

the weather and oceans Net Zero is also in our own self interest. Thank you for the opportunity to have my say. If any part of my
submission is published please only use my initial and surname (not my full name).
The Government needs to consider for Agriculture the full carbon cycle not half the cycle as it presently does and talk with NZ

Do your job! As human beings, you need to wake up, take responsibility, develop and grow in wisdom and compassion, leave the

greed and narcissism behind , STAND UP AND SPEAK TRUTH TO POWER BEYOND YOURSELVES , otherwise you will destroy this

The minister opens the discussion paper with references to the adverse impacts, but makes resolving them optional. The focus of

the government should be about action to adapt to climate change which is needed much sooner than trying to reduce the rate of
change which is a more long term goal.
Please can we have the best cross-party consensus here but please can we be guided by science and objectivity and not by self
interest or short term economic concerns. We are all going to have to change. We are all going to have to make some sacrifices and

suffer some short term losses perhaps. if we are smart, swift and innovative we can actually profit substantially, both in terms of a
healthy safe future and a booming carbon negative economy. Yes, carbon negative. We can help ourselves and others here and we

must try.
I have lived beside the Makara river in Wellington, less than 1km from the coast for the last 20 years. Over the last ten years, flooding

and storms have become more frequent. Or community is at risk of disappearing completely if we do not slow climate change. As a
middle-low income family, our home is our only asset, and our children's heritage. But more importantly, I want my children and their

future children to be able to grow up in a safe environment, which will almost definitely not be possible unless we take very clear and
brave actions to slow the current climate change. New Zealand is in an ideal situation to take a global lead on this matter, we can't

afford not to.
I regard this as the Govt's top priority.
As technology improves we can move closer to a zero economy.To rush into the and set goals that disadvantage us compared to

other countries is ridiculous .We need to follow not lead
I Support the direction of this Bill.
The climate change situation we face is existential. We need to be bold and address it aggressively, but with practicality in mind. Most
of the technical solutions we require are now already in place (with the exception of practical livestock methane solutions). What is

missing is political will and clear economic signals where the true externalized costs of climate change are included. We also need to
change our mindset and understand that change is coming so we should embrace it and reap the rewards of the many benefits it will
bring.
Strong leadership essential. Beware of greenwash and conflicts of interest as in promotion of EVs before we are clear on the carbon

involved in their production!
It is a relief to finally see some tangible action being taken by government on this issue! NZ contribute a very small proportion of
global emissions but that does not in anyway excuse us from action, especially considering our high per capita emissions and
emissions that are likely incurred offshore in relation to our own consumption. It is time NZ lays out a pathway to a positive and

environmental regenerative future to work towards and ensure the future liveability of our country and planet.
As mentioned earlier, I think it's important that the goal posts might have to be moved towards a carbon negative economy. This can

be achieved with including some form of support for organic and holistic soil management/agriculture and horticulture - imaginable is
a reward and penalty system for carbon negative or positive farming/forestry methods. Organic certification providers could be roped

in for this process combined with random soil testing and/or other methods (needs researching).
The issues are very complex and inter-related as banning one item, say oil can have a flow on effect to medical issues, lubrication for

transport issues, energy replacement issues for transport, industrial and commercial processing, heating and so on & on & on, to
name just one.
Not read.
I'd like to say that our adjustment to climate change is urgent and couldn't be more fundamental to our well-being both now and in
the future. I'd like to see the process of making change to reduce emissions to be based on all the sense, intelligence and care for

the environment that we are capable of. This form frustrates me a little because of it's narrow, technical focus and little
acknowledgement of the more general concerns that most NZers understand and focus on, and would like to express in a

submission. We can't always easily understand and assess your yes or no format.
While there are great opportunities, there will be significant costs to transition to a low-carbon economy. New Zealand should be

playing a greater role in tax reform, particularly internationally, so that transnational corporations are contributing their share. The
world is wealthy enough to manage the Transition but only if tax evasion is stamped out.
thank you all for taking action at last
Climate change is a function of the geometry of our solar system. Our sun is not stationary. It swings 9 planets around, Jupiter and
Saturn many times bigger than Earth. By Newton's 3rd law there must be a reaction to that force, and that causes the sun into an

orbit of it's own. For all the planets to realign from any point in time, (that is for the sun to complete it's orbit) probably takes
thousands of years. So within this timescale the earth will be closer and further from the sun, creating Iceages and warm periods. We

are currently heading for a warm period. There is nothing we can do.
Substantial action on climate change is well overdue, it's time to start catching up.

This is the biggest issue that we face, by far. It is essential that we join with other nations in reducing carbon emissions and preparing

for the climate change effects which are already inevitable. MPs need to know that they have our wholehearted support in tackling
these issues. They need to have the courage to take measures which may be unpopular in the short term, but are necessary for our

long term survival.
Over recent years livestock farming, and in particular dairy farming, has come in for major criticism as the leading source of green
house gas emissions in New Zealand. At its most basic level there may be a modicum of truth to this assertion. However I would

contend that in terms of animal emissions farming is already close to carbon neutral. To understand this assertion we must go back
to first principles. From my earliest days of third form general science I was taught the Law of the Conservation of Matter, which states
that matter can neither be created nor destroyed. It can however change its state. What this means in its simplest terms is that there

is no more carbon in the total environment now than there ever was; and if there is more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere now than
years ago we need to ascertain where it has come from. From a livestock perspective an animal can put out no more carbon in its

products, milk meat fibre, or digestive end products, than it ingests in its feed. So an animal takes up nutrients in its forage; carbon,
hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen etc. and reconfigures them into different end products, but the net sum is zero. University academics

can put the fancy names to processes but the truth of the matter is that everything in nature is cyclical, and in the case of carbon the
mechanism is photosynthesis. This, incidentally, is the same process whereby trees recycle carbon and take it out of the
environment. In agriculture the system is balanced. The forage animals live on grows by photosynthesis, and other cyclical pathways,

whereby products are removed from the environment, the animals eat the forage and emit it in one form or another. Soil micro-
organisms also play a major role in this process. If there was no recycling the whole system would have collapsed centuries ago and

humanity would have died from starvation. Furthermore, in addition to the forage farmers are growing which is incidentally taking
green house gases from the atmosphere, they are also making a huge contribution by planting farm forestry, riparian strips and

shelter belts. Therefore, I submit that animal emissions should not be included in the equation for green house gas calculations. So if
the net emissions are not coming from farming the question is, where do they come from; and the most obvious source is

combustion of fossil fuels which have been locked out of the biosphere for millennia but are now being reintroduced over time. I
acknowledge that the farming sector uses its share of these fuels and contend that farmers are prepared to make their fair
contribution towards mitigating the effects of these as is appropriate. This view will be unpalatable to the general public because for

years the news media has painted farmers as ecological villains. It is now time for a proper education process to explain why
agriculture will not be included in the Carbon Zero equation.
Focus zero emissions from fossil fuel use. Leave the rest alone. NZ could be entirely self sufficient on renewable electricity and
biofuels. Livestock emissions are not the problem. Do not publish my details on the website.
2 issues. Action should be taken now. Not plan-plan- and plan a bit more. Of course, do both, plan well, but do stuff now. The extra
taxes on fuel are a good idea. I would also like to see, really soon, buy-back subsidies or other stimuli for households and industry

feeding electricity into the net. Secondly: i consider myself green, but weak of resolve. I want to make green choices, but often don't
because 'my neighbours' (in a wide sense) do not. Point to make: I want to be forced to act green. That is why I voted for this

coalition government to come about. Thank you for your ear.
This is an excellent bill that is absolutely vital to pass. Once passed, I would like to see effective ways of reducing emissions (like

electric cars, zero use of coal, public transport, clean farming) communicated to the public and encouraged so they become
mainstream and an accepted part of normal social behaviour.
I strongly believe we need to set our targets, as a planet, for global warming to 1.5 degrees, not 2 degrees. 2 degrees is too warm for
many of our native species to survive. We need to lead this by example, in NZ, by setting bold zero emissions targets and achieving

this. This must be "set in stone", a piece of legislation that is not going to be overturned by different political parties being in
government, Our future depends on it. I am so excited our nation is working on this now, we have hope and can be an amazing

example to the rest of the world by doing this.
This is an exciting piece of proposed legislation. We know there are significant and severe implications of anthropogenic climate

disruption. It would be fantastic to see New Zealand leading the way with an ambitious target with detailed and sensible plans to aid
us to meet that target. I am truly looking forward to this being passed - something for our country to be proud of as we take steps to

acknowledge what has happened and change the current trajectory.
The most important principle that medical doctors are taught is "Do no harm". I believe that this should be the over-riding principle for
the Bill in relation to the New Zealand economy. New Zealand's contribution to global emissions is miniscule and hamstringing the
country's economy in an attempt to make futile changes is, in my opinion, unforgivable. I do not wish my name or email address to be

published on the Ministry for the Environment’s website, in any release to the public under the Official Information Act or in any
summary of submissions that the Ministry may publish.
In my opinion, their should be a mechanism that regularly checks on the progress of other comparable countries with similar goals, to
assess whether they have any new data or expertise that could assist us to achieve our own goals. This could involve two-way
information sharing/cooperation agreements, if not already in place. Additionally, a robust set of mechanisms should be laid out which

will fully 'air-gap' those who create, enforce, and are directly subject to Zero Carbon Bill policies from the influences of stakeholders
who are recognised as having a vested interest in delaying, degrading or obstructing effective climate change policy. I.e. no more

industry-led cooperation which simply allows companies to hollow out climate policy under the guise of stakeholder engagement,
and no Cambridge Analytica style influence campaigning by industry groups or individuals to dupe voters or economic sectors into

degrading the Zero Carbon Bill or carbon budgets. As a final note, out of left field, I think that education about food in our schools
should be made more robust and prominent in the curriculum, with more knowledge provided to students about how their eating
decisions may affect their environment, and practical kitchen skills which genuinely empower them to not only have strong control

over how their diet effects their environment, but their health and well-being as well.
If one swings a bucket of water around in a circle the arc it describes is constant, due to the fact we have friction between our feet

and the ground, if this attempted whilst standing in a small boat the result is very different, as we are now subject to the centrifugal
force of the bucket of water, but with no constant axis. This is in effect what the Sun is doing, except it has 9 planets spinning around

and many are huge compared to the Earth. The sun therefore, having no means of axis fixation, will move in its own orbit. This will vary
according to the alignment of the planets. The Sun will move in relation to the Earth, therefore producing warm periods and cool
periods. This occurs over many thousands of years, history tells us of ice ages. Sir Issac Newton figured this out with his 3rd Law of

Motion. This whole Zero Carbon Emission thing is whistling into the wind. The Govt should direct its energies and finances into things
it can change and benefit the population of New Zealand and not buy into the hysteria of the moment.
Only that this is in the "about time" slot and needs to be undertaken and implemented as soon as is viable.
Well done. Finally we seem to be confronting the issue directly without the obfuscation, delay and woolly words that permeate so

much other work on this subject from our government (previous) and industry / corporate citizens. Well done too on the simplicity
and accessibility of the submission process.




 
We need to move faster. We need to see progress. Individuals need the resources to implement what they can, when they can, as

they can. A structured education policy would be more use than - "We are already seeing significant climate change." Show us, that
by doing what we can it will make a difference and how we can make the most significant difference. I don't need convincing, but
there are thousands of citizens out there that can't really see how they can contribute and why.
We here in New Zealand with this Labour government are being taxed to death. Take a good look at Europe and their socialism
programs .... not working are they!!
I acknowledge Wise Response Inc. in preparing this submission.
This is crucially important for NZ and the world as a whole.




 
The Climate Change Commission should be established under a legislative framework that ensured it was not disbanded at the whim

of any future government. Given that political circumstances in New Zealand where, in almost all situations, the government of the
day controls Parliament, and the constitutional ability of Parliament to amend or repeal any statutes, some legislative security needs to
be provided for the Commission.
Please make this law strong enough so that subsequent governments cannot weaken it - we really need to stick to this for future

generations, if not aim to do even better. The law must be written in a way that it will be followed by every government that is in from
now to 2050. Also there must be stringent goals set to gradually move towards the 2050 target and robust testing and evaluation

methods to track our progress. Thank you for putting this through, it is a great moment for Aotearoa.
Its too late for comments other than to say it is well overdue for individuals to accept the reality of the 6th Mass Extinction and live

their remaining lives with Love, Peace and purpose towards Nature.
The Government needs to come up with a really good STORY to get most on NZers on board with this ... so that it isn't undone by a

future National Government ....please get your most talented people (who understand Psychology ...story telling etc) to do this ...you
must get buy in from the public!!!!
Most pressing need is to reduce transport emissions, so early involvement of transport planning groups and city councils is essential.
Secondly: promotion of actions to the general public that they can take in their own lives, and can cumulatively have a major effect.
Above all, urgency is needed, so getting things put in place as soon as possible, modified as we go, rather than over-planning and

delay. The longer we leave it, the harder it will get, and the greater the impact on our people.
Climate is changing as it always has but the biggest threat is sitting underground or some sort of mutant bacteria.
Good on ya! We really need action on this from a pragmatic and moral perspective.
It is wonderful and a profound relief to see legislation such as the Zero Carbon Bill being proposed, and I wish it great success. This is
a critically important issue, and we must face it head on with all the resources and knowledge we can bring to bear.




 
I am old enough to remember living in a non-plastic, non-touristic New Zealand, where milk and houses were cheap and affordable

and good quality, university was free, medical care was almost free, cars were expensive and rare, and we had many local industries
producing good quality goods. New Zealand families could afford to travel around New Zealand, though not overseas, so we grew to
know and love our country. There were trains and ships as well as roads and cars. We hadn't embarked on the disastrous dairy

expansion at that point, but we knew that the world was beginning to be in crisis. If we had had governments then who had listened
to the warnings, we wouldn't be in this situation now. We could have made changes in energy production then. There was new

technology for wind energy, that was not adopted, there were new building techniques that used fewer resources, that were not
adopted. There were radical moves that took the country into a new world of unimagined wealth for a few, inequity and poverty for

many, cheap goods, luxury goods, cheap travel and overall huge debt, all of which has been killing the planet over time. It is unlikely
that this government or any other in the world will take the truly radical steps needed to address at least the current situation

effectively. But we can hope, for our grandchildren and great-grandchildren's sake.
The elephant in the room is the farming industry which in NZ contributes 60% to our greenhouse gas emissions and currently is not
included in the ETS. Obviously farming is an important cornerstone to our economy so any change needs to be done in a respectful

and mindful way. Options could include a commitment, in collaboration with the MOH, encouraging vegetable based diets with the
inherent spin-off effects of improved health such as a reduction in heart disease and bowel cancer. Also there could be commitment

to funding R&D into less methane-producing feed for stock and for genetic selection for less gas producing breeds. Another option
is proactive support for changing land use such as converting farms to horticulture or forestry. This could have further benefits on
water and air quality, especially tree planting on waterways.
The government has to take responsibility for reducing greenhouse gas emissions across the board to net zero. It must do this
through: - new legislation to encourage proactivity - funding towards the public transport and environmental sectors - support for at

risk industries - support for those in soon to be reduced industries to find new areas of work and financial stability - sufficient
incentive for innovators to create new and widespread sustainable technologies and business sectors - sufficient incentives for

existing corporate, industrial and agricultural high-emitters to reduce emissions to net zero by 2050 - committing to net zero
emissions by 2050, and protecting this initiative as it is imperative to the survival and long-term wealth and safety of our country -
smart marketing and PR to keep and grow support of the greater public of New Zealand - the creation of a new Ministry for climate

change (or equivalent) to create new roles for experts across numerous related fields to work together on a long term reduction in
emissions (climate change mitigation,) and climate change adaptation which can be put into effect promptly and effectively - the

creation of a climate change commission of diverse experts (equal numbers of male and female, diverse ethnicity, body types and
also inclusive of at least one disabled persons.) - Giving the CCC powers to act, rather than just to advise. The government of New

Zealand must also have more frequent, much better advertised opportunities for submission and advocacy from all members of our
population, as many have missed out this time due to severe lack of outreach.




 
The economy was constructed around oil and gas without accounting for costs of climate change or resource depletion. Either of

 these factors make the consumption of fossil fuels entirely uneconomic now. That's a catastrophic mistake which needs to be
 corrected but where's your transition plan? Banning oil and gas is the right decision but it means shutting down Methenex and Tiwai,
 you need to face that consequence as it impacts many people's lives. There's going to be a huge disruption to the economy and

 jobs won't be replaced. That's an inevitable consequence of increasing technological progress, as jobs are replaced (a good thing)
 unless people take more leisure time there aren't enough jobs to go around. This should be a luxury problem a benefit but we have
 turned it into an economic disaster through inequality. As we have stopped looking for oil and gas in NZ and globally we risk price

 spikes, the next government will simply roll back your plans in the face of these anyway. Only an idealist would believe the
 government can stand against the corporations who own the country. What other businesses will shut down if we are importing
 $12/GJ LNG from under the Pilliga forest via SANTOS? I think this legislation is well intentioned but ineffectual. Lots of highly paid
 useless wafflers without any skin in the game pontificating on what everyone else should do.




  
Yes, I would like to make some points about how we get to negative Nett emissions by 2050: It’s pretty obvious really, we need a
pretty much wholesale change from animal protein to plant based protein diets across the world and an all but complete shift from
animal agriculture to growing tree crops (avocados, other fruit, nuts), grains, ground nuts, pulses etc. Farmers don’t have to stop

farming, they just have to stop farming animals. There are so many other reasons for moving away from animal farming (surface water
pollution, aquafer pollution, poor production of protein per unit of land, per unit of water) that if we are going to feed the worlds 9

billion people we can’t afford to stay with such an inefficient means of production. And if we care about other living creatures what
place does eating them have? We need create carbon stores wherever possible. One is a “wood first” basis for all our buildings, so

you have to have a very peculiar reason to use steel or concrete columns and beams in commercial buildings as well as domestic. We
need to have an earth first approach to adding thermal mass in buildings (eg asking why can’t you use earth floors, earth walls etc in

this situation). Why are you not using carbon storing strawbale insulation rather than glass fibre batts (that have been produced at
1000°C). Why are you not using timber windows and doors? This is not just to reduce emissions from steel, concrete, fibreglass
manufacture, but to have our commercial buildings as well as residential buildings acting as carbon stores. We need to have thermal

power stations sited where the residual heat can be used to displace the coal burnt in greenhouses (like the Waimea plains here in
Nelson), that supplies heat and electricity just at the time that heat and power is needed (winter evenings when the grid is

struggling), but furthermore is designed to produce biochar to permanently lock up the carbon the trees have absorbed from the
atmosphere. And this biochar can be used as a soil enhancer as well as a permanent carbon store. And of course we need to

reafforest most of the country, a lot of it with perpetual native carbon forests – certainly areas within 10m for every 1m of width of
watercourse. We need to move freight by the most efficient means of steel wheels on steel rails using electricity as the fuel, by
extending and electrifying the rail network in the country (the argument of double handling costs is largely taken over by using curtain

sider containers (perhaps using the additional advantage of containers of being able to be left in factories to be loaded at their
leisure), taken by electric short range trucks, to the railhead, container moved directly from truck to rail wagon, taken by rail to

destination where container is transferred to electric truck and to destination – again perhaps left to be unloaded at the destinations
leisure. Electric main trunk lines are of course a well established technology, but electric delivery trucks are already available too.

Settlement patterns are a crucial and overlooked way of transitioning to a low carbon, necessarily energy efficient way of living. It is
hard to see sprawling suburbia often covering productive soils, ever being able to be served well or efficiently by public or active

transport. Additionally it is a waste of resources with the extra length of trench, pipes, footpath, and roadway. We need to be free to
build a second dwelling on our close in suburbs (building a second dwelling in far flung suburbs does nothing, that is not what I am
asking for), make it easier to build up to our side boundaries 2 stories. The mantra needs to be, the next time you buy a new house

(and I believe we do this every 7 years on average) buy closer to where you work, school or recreate. Electric Bikes, Cycles, buses in
bus lanes, trams and trains on their separate networks need to be acknowledged as the only way of dealing with road congestion:

widespread commuting by electric cars, however worthy a replacement for fossil cars in terms of climate change, are still just as much
a disaster for urban form, livable cities and urban life. So whilst of course there needs to be a savage feebate for motor vehicles

coming into the country, with high emitting vehicles of any type paying a lot in feebates, while the most efficient in terms of CO2
emissions getting a big grant towards their purchase price from the feebate scheme, we mustn’t kid ourselves that electric cars will

do anything to improve the inefficient land use car commuting demands. With roads and car parking taking up at least a half of our
cities walkability is destroyed, liveable cities are impossible. Sewerage Schemes and Landfills should be designed to be first and

foremost methane producers to generate a supply of non fossil gas. Certain gas uses like cooking with gas are not so easy to
substitute out with electricity. Renewable methane availability will be a good substitute.
NZ interest in biochar bloomed early in 2009 when the government funded ‘NZ Biochar Research Centre’ at Massey University began
 its work. Worldwide interest in biochar has grown almost exponentially over the last 15 years, as reflected in the growth in published

 literature on the subject and reports on international industry growth. NZ interest and activity associated with biochar has not kept
 pace with this international action. We now see a strong NZ resurgence in community interest and business activity in biochar. This
 interest and activity is currently localised, informal, poorly coordinated and unfunded. Biochar offers opportunities for multiple and

 cascading environmental benefits... all leading to carbon sequestration. Many biomass sources are available (wilding pine, coppice
 crops, forest/crop residues) along with co-product opportunities (heat, pyroligneous acids, etc) for small industry. Positive impacts on

 agriculture practices, water quality and nutrient management will also flow from biochar production and applications. The NZ
 government appears to be poorly informed on the interest and opportunities related to the resurgence of biochar activity.




  
Addressing climate change is a matter of urgency. As a country we need to make binding commitments to reduce in a planned and

progressive way our emissions. Simultaneously we need to be creating within NZ greater carbon sink green areas. We should not be
purchasing off shore carbon credits. Rather we should ensure that NZ is carbon neutral.
Thank you for the opportunity to submit on this crucial issue. I am a New Zealander, a trained engineer, a trainee doctor, and a
parent, and therefore I cannot exhort you more strongly to put ambitious and importantly, binding strategies in place to reach zero
emissions. I want New Zealand to be a leader on the international stage with regards to our approach. We can inspire other countries,

be on the right side of history, and transform our economy to be more intelligent and sustainable. My training in engineering makes it
clear to me that risks from climate change are real, present and extremely expensive - strong action to prevent climate change and

mitigate its effects are the most environmentally and economically sound response to this massive challenge. Physics does not care
what the ideology of a particular government is, and a strong response to climate change should not be a political issue. I am one

year away from qualifying as a doctor. We know that the effects of climate change on health are going to be increasingly dramatic, with
new diseases and natural disasters causing morbidity and mortality in ways that are currently unknown to New Zealanders. Vulnerable

populations are particularly at risk and thus mitigating climate change is an important part of health equity in an already very unequally
healthy society. Finally, I am desperate for my two young children to inherit a society, economy, and world that is smart, sustainable,
safe, and equitable. I often speak to them about how we elect our leaders to make brave decisions that help us make our societies

better, and I call on you to show true leadership and commit to ambitious, binding targets that we can be proud of. The science
shows us that we have no other option, so let's be ahead of the curve and ride out this challenge in style. With thanks and respect,

Robina Stevens
The pressures particularly on smaller communities are series and the funding required should be subsidised by central government

and not left only to local government.
Huge challenges require great courage to face fierce opposition to worthy goals. Success comes from collaboration. The true battle
is always for the hearts and minds of the people. People follow leaders who model their values in their actions. Be bold and follow

through.
Good to see this initiative as a concrete step forward on climate change. Let me, again, stress the importance of the proposed
Commission looking broadly at opportunities within NZ to reduce emissions. Having experience in electricity utility governance

overseas, I see opportunities for helping to achieve reduced carbon emissions that have not been taken on board yet in NZ.
Mandated reporting requirements will serve to improve transparency and will assist organisations and Government in more effective
risk management.
Thank you for this useful format for making a submission. I am the author of a book on coastal hazards and climate change, with

particular reference to sea-level rise and increasing storminess in New Zealand and the atoll nations of the South Pacific - "The
Invading Sea", due to be released in October 2018 (The Cuba Press, Wellington).
More information supplied to public would be good
I would like to emphasise how strong action on waste minimisation could have the potential to produce significant GHG emission
reductions. I believe this potential should be taken seriously in MfE's work, and there should be strong links between the Climate

Change Commission and the waste team.
The current underlying model of economic growth being able to continue indefinitely when the World's resouces are limited is flawed.

This must be part of a wider risk assessment.
NZ might be a small player globally, but we have among the highest per capita emissions. We need to take responsibility and reduce
our emissions. Shifting to a low carbon future by reducing emissions should be our main priority. Not trying to find ways to continue

business as usual. We are already seeing serious climate change with only 1 degree of warming so need to act now. A sustainable
low carbon economy and society has so many other benefits to the health of people and the planet. This is the future and we will be

left behind and we risk our international reputation if we stick to intensive methane producing agriculture and a car-dependent
society. The sooner we act the smoother this transition will be.
Now is the time for action. Let's not ignore what is needed to be done but get started!
Yes. New Zealand has an important role to play in world politics. Our small size and relative independence is an advantage. We can try
new ways of doing things which are difficult for countries with larger populations. We are used to innovation and are resourceful .i
believe our children's future lies in protecting our natural resources. These I suggest will become ever more valuable and the main

source of our economy. I also think, that as long as the economy is not going backward, there is not much to worry about providing
that what there is is shared!

Climate change and thus emission reduction is the most crucial issue we are facing and MUST be attended to seriously and strongly.

The consequences, in particular for the next few generations, are of a magnitude few of us can imagine. We MUST behave
responsibly for the future human (and non human) inhabitants of our planet and country.
We only have ONE planet. We are time-space travellers (Geonaughts) on spaceship Earth. We must NOT allow politicians who are
concerned with re-election: nor big corporations who are concerned with profit: nor apathetic, short-sighted, selfish individuals, to

drive us to the 6th Global Extermination.
From my own personal experience I have seen the effects of climate change. We cannot put off taking decisive and strong action.

The government needs to take the lead and put policies and laws in place to make this happen. Meanwhile on a grassroots level
each person living in NZ needs to be committed to making and supporting the required changes. We do need to keep having these

conversations to get all of us heading in the same direction regarding climate change goals.
Focus should be on reducing emissions from petrol-driven vehicles, use of chemical sprays, plastics, manufactured perfumes,

cleaning products, fleecy materials etc. etc. And ALL important; planning for the changes in climate already here and into the near
future; floods, sea inundation, storms with the resultant damage to structures, power supplies, drinking water and possible injuries

and or deaths. Emergency services; police, fire and ambulance should be part of the overall picture. NB/ Found the 'Our Climate Your
Say; website but could not find the relevant pages referred to in the questions :O(
The world is watching us, let's be brave and get on with this. We're also attracting interest from some of the worlds most influential

people; if we continue boldly down this path, we will attract their support to transition to a circular economy; of which this act plays an
important part.




 
Climate change is a natural process that mankind has only a marginal effect upon. Until real evidence emerges of detrimental effects,

rather than computer models that have been proven to give major overestimates of warming, no legislative action should be taken,
other than aspirational.
It is time to be brave and put in place policy and structure that leads the world, seizing the opportunity this point in time provides us
to change our course.
A Zero Carbon Act is important to me because it is clear to me that to avoid increasing global mean surface temperatures by more
than 2°C above pre-industrial levels, that there is a fixed amount of carbon that can be added to the atmosphere – there is no such

thing as a ‘sustainable level of CO2 emissions’. Therefore, ultimately, emissions must go to zero, and likely need to go negative some
time in the next few decades to avoid that 2°C threshold. It is imperative that by the time my children are my age we are no longer

adding carbon to the atmosphere. The process for achieving that goal must start now. The best way to implement that process is
through legislation. I am therefore 100% in support of the Zero Carbon Act goal of zero emissions by 2050.
We need to act now, not by 2050, 2030.... Something the green party has been advocating for. decades. Let's work towards
implementation by 2020.
Effects of Climate Change are still not well understood. There needs to be a mandatory aspect that the Committee publishes regular

easy to read progress reports and publicity on progress suitable for children through to adults as it are the next few generations that
are likely to be most seriously affected by decisions
Lets get on with it. This is an important issue which requires immediate action. We have wasted enough time thanks to the NATS.
I am involved in a very progressive local community gardenand an active Transition Towns Pt Chevalier member where we discuss CC
issues and trying to do our informed bit as much as we can - we could have a bigger impact if govt sets targets and we are enabled

to recruit more people on board to help reach these targets on an individual/household local basis. I am actively involved in activities
with the group to support sustainable living practices. I also feel we as a quite wealthy country must address some of the excessive

damage we have created to climate change that is affecting our Pacific Island neighbours who are suffering the most and have been
minimal emitters. It is because of these interests and social concerns and my concern for the planet and for future generations that I

fully support the Green Party in its aim to pass the Zero Carbon Act as proposed. My partner and I don't have children and are in our
mid-late 50s, we could just go ahead, enjoy our live and fcku up the planet as there's no blood-relative coming after us - but that's not
how we think, we want as many people as fit healthily on this earth without living over its boundaries to enjoy the one life they are

given - just as we are allowed to.




 
I would like to advocate for a strategy of fair and just ‘economic adaptation’ towards a doughnut economic model. I use this term
‘economic adaptation’ to reference the exciting opportunity to redesign our low-carbon economy in a way ensures a just transition for

workers employed in high-carbon jobs while also ensure we take care of our most vulnerable in society. By moving away from a neo-
liberal focus on GDP as the only measure of prosperity, we can re-design an economy that sits within the doughnut of planetary
boundaries and focuses on the equality and well-being of the people. Urgent action will need to be taken to create a low-carbon

economy, for this reason it will be essential to strengthen the safety net created by our government so as to ensure that no one is
left behind on this journey.




 
We as a nation have to make significant changes in all areas of our lifes. This issue can't be solved by any one group: industry,

transport, individuals. We're in it together. The biggest thing in my mind is a cultural shift to less consumerism (in all its forms) and
more community engagement and empathy. Only such a shift in individuals can successfully change behaviour of business and

Industrie. Governments can support such a culture shift through education, incentives and regulation/legislation.
I do not agree with tree planting as an off-setting mechanism. We face catastrophic consequences NOW and trees take decades to
grow. We need to reduce our use and our population. We need brave Governments who will stand up to greed, who will rise taxes
and help up manage the appalling situation we have created for our kids.
If the Zero Carbon Bill becomes law it will seek to chart NZ's course from its present level of carbon emissions to those considered
desirable and achievable by 2050. The circumstances that will prevail in 2050 are unknowable. It will be the function of interim

governments to continue to monitor the desirability and achievability of the 2050 target, NZ's progress towards achieving it ( or its
revised iteration), and its effects on NZ's citizens.
As noted in the discussion document, mandatory reporting is likely to deliver better outcomes than voluntary reporting.
Biggest issue is transitioning to a neutral emissions target that includes EVERYONE. It is likely to affect everyone in every sector. Be it
private citizens, industry, agriculture, tourism, transport, etc. everyone has a role to play and contribute. I think transport is something
that has the most potential for improvement for people from a wide range of sectors. More freight transported by rail, increased

patronage on public transport or bike, reducing the number of vehicles in New Zealand are potential transport goals to aim for.




 
I strongly support this bill and the net zero target and the commitment of the Government to leadership in both mitigation and

adaptation.
As will be clear from the comments above - I am concerned that NZ has wasted almost a decade (with significant cumulative

emissions in that time) because politics was allowed to get in the way of science. It is urgently time to turn that around and set up
systems that are distinctly science led. I am concerned that the conversation about co-benefits has not been well explored. At the
presentation in Hawke's Bay (and presumably elsewhere), the idea of land use change was put up as a "challenge" wheras we

already have a number of influential sectors and leaders clamouring for land use change for a wide variety of reasons - notably water
quality & quantity. So land use change should properly go on the "benefits" side of the balance sheet. When we start to actively

consider the co-benefits of some of the proposed actions we see a wide variety of social and environmental gains to add to the GHG
benefits. This tends to encourage us to look at even bolder and more creative solutions. Small changes bring small benefits and

limited alteration to the status quo - conversely, what we are needing is major benefits and profound alterations to the status quo so
we should be looking at the most grand and radical of changes.
Farming is the single biggest threat to climate change and NZ punches well above its weight. the methane, transportation, feed .....
Most other first world countries have normalised veganism.
We also need an examination of what sort of future we can afford. Current encouragement of unsustainable consumption, eg

excessively big and extravagant cars, houses , financial manipulation etc is toxic in the medium and long term. To maintain social
cohesion in rapidly and radically changing times will require major effort and education.
Please be bold, be leaders on this issue. The prospect of net-zero greenhouse gas emissions Aotearoa is exciting but also
necessary.




 
Let's do this!
Be legendary. Be heroes. Get on with it. We need a net-zero carbon future for all. I feel that the F&B submission nails it all for me - see
below: We need to make dramatic reductions in our emissions to keep climate change limited to 1.5 degrees and ensure our
precious native plants and animals are protected. Nature is our taonga and we cannot exist without it. We must act together. The key

things I support in a Zero Carbon Act are: A target for net-zero carbon emissions by 2040 should be in the Act. The emissions from
transport, industrial activity, agriculture, and all other sources should be included in the target. Even ‘short-lived’ gasses can have a

huge effect on our climate and need to be reduced. Emissions budgets should be at least as important as fiscal budgets, and the
Government should set plans to achieve them. An independent Climate Change Commission of experts should monitor emissions

and give advice to keep New Zealand on-track for its emissions reduction goals.
Further monitoring of global temeparature is required. Satellite monitoring of temperature over the last 30 years shows that the global

warming models overestimate the temperature rise.
Please see "Additional notes" attached.
This Bill is an opportunity for New Zealand to take a stand internationally and demonstrate its commitment to stalling climate change.

A strong and committed stance will gain NZ international respect, and will also benefit the tourist industry, which, let's face it, may go
a long way to offsetting any resultant losses in the mining and agricultural sectors. The success of the Bill hinges on the

independence of the Climate Commission, and the fact that the effects are long-term, and legally binding to successive
governments. I believe that we should not underplay the influence and assistance we can provide for local (South Pacific) neighbours

with regard to climate change, and urge the legislators to view the Bill on a Pacific, not simply national, level. I believe there should be
flexibility in the role of the Commission to be expanded in the future to include, for example, assisting our neighbours to implement
similar measures, ocean clean-ups, reduction of solid waste, etc in the future. Wouldn't it be fantastic if the climate commissions of

countries such as NZ and the UK had international influence and could put pressure on less conscientious nations to follow our lead.
Please don't let us miss this opportunity to do the right thing, New Zealand. There will be economic effects, but the health of our

people and our planet has to come before profit.
We are moving from duel to electric vehicles but how are we gonna deal with these batteries when they come to the end of life.
MOST IMPORTANTLY our mobile network is growing at a very fast pace and this is emitting a huge amount of radiation which causes

cancer and I think that should be a top priority.
Climate change and thus emission reduction is the most crucial issue we are facing and MUST be attended to seriously and strongly.

The consequences, in particular for the next few generations, are of a magnitude few of us can imagine. We MUST behave
responsibly for the future human (and non human) inhabitants of our planet and country.
This needs a whole of government approach.

These 8 words are the death of climate change - "It violates the Equivalence Principle, therefore it's wrong." The Equivalence Principle

says - If data cannot distinguish between two things, then the two things are identical. The IPCC claims human emissions will linger in
the atmosphere for hundreds of years, and 15% will remain forever. That claim violates the Equivalence Principle. Nature's CO2 has a

half life in the atmosphere of only <5 years. Therefore human CO2 also has a half life of <5 years. Nature cannot distinguish between
the two sources.

Government will need to put some incentives in place to accelerate change if they want to achieve the 30% reduction set out in the

Paris agreement.
Just do this
Climate change will require wider spheres of management than just emissions reductions.
It is time for New Zealand to lead again. We have a history of global leadership: we were the first country to give women the vote and

the first to become nuclear free. It is time to take another giant step towards climate justice globally. New Zealand has demonstrated
global leadership with our commitment to stopping oil and gas exploration – now let us continue that moral leadership and include

transparency in what and how we support climate change efforts abroad.
The old "divide and conquer" approach will not work. It will require unparalleled transparency and collaboration.
Ensure that this legislation creates a sound and resilient base for further developments as the need for them are anticipated. Add a
provision that requires establishment and continual refinement of Climate Change Future Insight, the scope of which is determined

by the needs of NZ decision-makers, both public and private.
Climate change is real and needs urgent and real solutions. An Independent Climate Change Commission of experts is urgently
needed to consider all aspects pertaining to Climate Change. Their views and advice must be binding on any change of Government,

if we are to have any chance of mitigating the negative impacts of climate change, both in New Zealand and globally.




 
THE ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM! CLIMATE CHANGE IS THE MOST URGENT AND IMPORTANT ECONOMIC,SOCIAL,ENVIRONMENTAL,AND

HEALTH PROBLEM OF OUR AGE. IT NEEDS TACKLING ON A WAR FOOTING - THINK OF CHURCHILL AND WORLD WAR 2 !

All possible encouragement needs to be offered to business and individuals to move to a zero carbon economy. This may be in

grants, subsidies and incentives such as to encourage the uptake of electric vehicles and renewable power sourcing.
Fantastic Discussion document.
It doesn't take too much research to see that there is an entirely different and much more valid perspective by way of explanation for
any changes we may perceive occurring to our climate. I urge decision makers to investigate for themselves prior to making any
costly policy decisions. While there are many websites, documents, videos and other forms or media that I could upload or link, the

one I chose to attach called "Groupthink" is a good starting point. For goodness sake, read and absorb it. I do not wish my name to
be published.




 
I have made it clear that this whole exercise is total waste of time and if implemented will balloon into just another taxpayer funded
bureaucratic hole to pour our money into endlessly.
